## Issue for missing fortran

sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev gfortran

## Comments from others
- draw graphs while changing paramters to have intuitive ideas
- can set some intuitive rules to find supervisor-supervisee relations
    - supervisor has paper > 5
    - P(supervisee | supervisor) = 1

## Comments from TA
- orange is a good pkg as well
- How to set threshold: use statistical features
- can combine features(lift, confidence, support) to create new feature

# Stage 2

## Comments from others
- Should do better visualization, especially for results(wordcloud, other fancy graphical interfaces)

## Comments from TA/instructor
- Don't only think of BoW on every single words, think about phrases, or at least "size-2", "size-3" metawords
- Should evaluate at every step
