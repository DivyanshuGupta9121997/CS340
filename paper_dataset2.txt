We motivate the problem and present an efficient algorithm that identifies error-tolerant frequent clusters of items in transactional data (customer-purchase data, web browsing data, text, etc.). The algorithm exploits sparseness of the underlying data to find large groups of items that are correlated over database records (rows). The notion of transaction coverage allows us to extend the algorithm and view it as a fast clustering algorithm for discovering segments of similar transactions in binary sparse data. We evaluate the new algorithm on three real-world applications: clustering high-dimensional data, query selectivity estimation and collaborative filtering. Results show that the algorithm consistently uncovers structure in large sparse databases that other traditional clustering algorithms fail to find.

The fundamental analysis component is a path. A path is a finite sequence of elements, typically representing URLs or groups of URLs. A full path is an abstraction of a visit or a session, which can contain attributes described below. Subpaths represent interesting subsequences of the full paths.Path Analysis provides user-configurable extraction, filtering, preprocessing, noise reduction, descriptive statistics and detailed analysis of three basic specific objects: elements, (sub)paths, and couples of elements. In each case, lists of frequent objects --- subject to particular filtering and sorting --- are available. We call the corresponding interactive tools Element, Path, and Couple Analyzers.We also allow in-depth exploration of individual elements, paths, and couples: Element Explorer investigates composition and convergence of traffic through an element and allows conditioning based on the number of preceding/succeeding steps. Path Explorer visualizes in and out flows of a path and attrition rate along the path. Couple Explorer presents distinct paths connecting couple elements, along with measures of their association and some additional statistics.

Given two data sets, the similarity join computes all tuples (x, y) that are within a distance &egr;.One of the most efficient algorithms for processing similarity-joins is the Multidimensional-Spatial Join (MSJ) by Koudas and Sevcik. In our previous work --- pursued for the two-dimensional case --- we found however that MSJ has several performance shortcomings in terms of CPU and I/O cost as well as memory-requirements. Therefore, MSJ is not generally applicable to high-dimensional data.In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named Generic External Space Sweep (GESS). GESS introduces a modest rate of data replication to reduce the number of expensive distance computations. We present a new cost-model for replication, an I/O model, and an inexpensive method for duplicate removal. The principal component of our algorithm is a highly flexible replication engine.Our analytical model predicts a tremendous reduction of the number of expensive distance computations by several orders of magnitude in comparison to MSJ (factor 107). In addition, the memory requirements of GESS are shown to be lower by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the I/O cost of our algorithm is by factor 2 better (independent from the fact whether replication occurs or not). Our analytical results are confirmed by a large series of simulations and experiments with synthetic and real high-dimensional data sets.

Although the concept of local outliers is a useful one, the computation of LOF values for every data objects requires a large number of &kgr;-nearest neighbors searches and can be computationally expensive. Since most objects are usually not outliers, it is useful to provide users with the option of finding only n most outstanding local outliers, i.e., the top-n data objects which are most likely to be local outliers according to their LOFs. However, if the pruning is not done carefully, finding top-n outliers could result in the same amount of computation as finding LOF for all objects. In this paper, we propose a novel method to efficiently find the top-n local outliers in large databases. The concept of ""micro-cluster"" is introduced to compress the data. An efficient micro-cluster-based local outlier mining algorithm is designed based on this concept. As our algorithm can be adversely affected by the overlapping in the micro-clusters, we proposed a meaningful cut-plane solution for overlapping data. The formal analysis and experiments show that this method can achieve good performance in finding the most outstanding local outliers."

For example, given feature vectors of healthy and of non-healthy patients, we want to answer the following questions: Are the two clouds of points separable? What is the smallest/largest pair-wise distance across the two datasets? Which of the two clouds does a new point (feature vector) come from?We propose a new tool, the tri-plot, and its generalization, the pq-plot, which help us answer the above questions. We provide a set of rules on how to interpret a tri-plot, and we apply these rules on synthetic and real datasets. We also show how to use our tool for classification, when traditional methods (nearest neighbor, classification trees) may fail.

In this paper, a multimedia data mining framework for discovering important but previously unknown knowledge such as vehicle identification, traffic flow, and the spatio-temporal relations of the vehicles at the intersections from traffic video sequences is proposed. The proposed multimedia data mining framework analyzes the traffic video sequences by using background subtraction, image/video segmentation, object tracking, and modeling with multimedia augmented transition network (MATN) model and multimedia input strings, in the domain of traffic monitoring over an intersection. The spatio-temporal relationships of the vehicle objects in each frame are discovered and accurately captured and modeled. Such an additional level of sophistication enabled by the proposed multimedia data-mining framework in terms of spatio-temporal tracking generates a capability for automation. This capability alone can significantly influence and enhance current data processing and implementation strategies for several problems vis-à-vis traffic operations. A real-life traffic video sequence is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed multimedia data mining framework.

Examples include market basket data in retail commerce, telephone call records in telecommunications, and Web logs of individual page-requests at Web sites. Profiling consists of using historical transaction data on individuals to construct a model of each individual's behavior. Simple profiling techniques such as histograms do not generalize well from sparse transaction data. In this paper we investigate the application of probabilistic mixture models to automatically generate profiles from large volumes of transaction data. In effect, the mixture model represents each individual's behavior as a linear combination of ""basis transactions."" We evaluate several variations of the model on a large retail transaction data set and show that the proposed model provides improved predictive power over simpler histogram-based techniques, as well as being relatively scalable, interpretable, and flexible. In addition we point to applications in outlier detection, customer ranking, interactive visualization, and so forth. The paper concludes by comparing and relating the proposed framework to other transaction-data modeling techniques such as association rules."

To this end, we perform several types of analysis on the session tracking database that records user navigation histories. First, using both explicit and implicit measures of user satisfaction, we infer a ""solved count"" representing the average utility of an FAQ. Second, using the user navigation patterns we construct a link matrix representing connections between FAQs. The technique of building up the link matrix and using it to advise users on related information amounts to a form of the ""swarm intelligence"" method of finding optimal paths. Both solved count and the link matrix are continuously updated as users interact with the site; furthermore, they are periodically ""aged"" to emphasize recent activity. The synergistic combination of these techniques allows users to learn from the database in a more effective manner, as evidenced by usage statistics."

Web Usage Mining refers to the discovery of interesting information from user navigational behavior as stored in web access logs. While extracting simple information from web logs is easy, mining complex structural information is very challenging. Data cleaning and preparation constitute a very significant effort before mining can even be applied. We propose two new XML applications, XGMML and LOGML to help us in this task. XGMML is a graph description language and LOGML is a web-log report description language. We generate a web graph in XGMML format for a web site using the web robot of the WWWPal system. We generate web-log reports in LOGML format for a web site from web log files and the web graph. We further illustrate the usefulness of LOGML in web usage mining; we show the simplicity with which mining algorithms (for extracting increasingly complex frequent patterns) can be specified and implemented efficiently using LOGML.

ANALYSIS OF OPEN ANSWERS	Surveys are an important part of marketing and customer relationship management, and open answers (i.e., answers to open questions) in particular may contain valuable information and provide an important basis for making business decisions. We have developed a text mining system that provides a new way for analyzing open answers in questionnaire data. The product is able to perform the following two functions: (A) accurate extraction of characteristics for individual analysis targets, (B) accurate extraction of the relationships among characteristics of analysis targets. In this paper, we describe the working of our text mining system. It employs two statistical learning techniques: rule analysis and Correspondence Analysis for performing the two functions. Our text mining system has already been put into use by a number of large corporations in Japan in the performance of text mining on various types of survey data, including open answers about brand images, open answers about company images, complaints about products, comments written on home pages, business reports, and help desk records. In this it has been found to be useful in forming a basis for effective business decisions.

We assess the novelty of a rule by the average semantic distance in a knowledge hierarchy between the words in the antecedent and the consequent of the rule - the more the average distance, more is the novelty of the rule. The novelty of rules extracted by the DiscoTEX text-mining system on Amazon.com book descriptions were evaluated by both human subjects and by our algorithm. By computing correlation coefficients between pairs of human ratings and between human and automatic ratings, we found that the automatic scoring of rules based on our novelty measure correlates with human judgments about as well as human judgments correlate with one another. @Text mining

The experimental results confirm the performance improvements previously claimed by the authors on the artificial data, but some of these gains do not carry over to the real datasets, indicating overfitting of the algorithms to the IBM artificial dataset. More importantly, we found that the choice of algorithm only matters at support levels that generate more rules than would be useful in practice. For support levels that generate less than 1,000,000 rules, which is much more than humans can handle and is sufficient for prediction purposes where data is loaded into RAM, Apriori finishes processing in less than 10 minutes. On our datasets, we observed super-exponential growth in the number of rules. On one of our datasets, a 0.02% change in the support increased the number of rules from less than a million to over a billion, implying that outside a very narrow range of support values, the choice of algorithm is irrelevant.

Therefore, techniques have recently been proposed to find clusters in hidden subspaces of the data. However, since the behavior of the data may vary considerably in different subspaces, it is often difficult to define the notion of a cluster with the use of simple mathematical formalizations. In fact, the meaningfulness and definition of a cluster is best characterized with the use of human intuition. In this paper, we propose a system which performs high dimensional clustering by effective cooperation between the human and the computer. The complex task of cluster creation is accomplished by a combination of human intuition and the computational support provided by the computer. The result is a system which leverages the best abilities of both the human and the computer in order to create very meaningful sets of clusters in high dimensionality.

To this end, we propose new splitting criteria for growing trees. Conventional splitting criteria attempt to perform well on both sides of a split by attempting a compromise in the quality of fit between the left and the right side. By contrast, we adopt a data mining point of view by proposing criteria that search for interesting subsets of the data, as opposed to modeling all of the data equally well. The new criteria do not split based on a compromise between the left and the right bucket; they effectively pick the more interesting bucket and ignore the other.As expected, the result is often a simpler characterization of interesting subsets of the data. Less expected is that the new criteria often yield whole trees that provide more interpretable data descriptions. Surprisingly, it is a ""flaw"" that works to their advantage: The new criteria have an increased tendency to accept splits near the boundaries of the predictor ranges. This so-called ""end-cut problem"" leads to the repeated peeling of small layers of data and results in very unbalanced but highly expressive and interpretable trees."

Clustering and sequential analysis are two primary techniques for mining navigational patterns from Web and application server logs. The characteristics of the log data and mining tasks require new data representation methods and analysis algorithms to be tested in the e-commerce environment. In this paper we present a cube model to represent Web access sessions for data mining. The cube model organizes session data into three dimensions. The COMPONENT dimension represents a session as a set of ordered components {c 1, c 2,..., c P }, in which each component c i indexes the ith visited page in the session. Each component is associated with a set of attributes describing the page indexed by it, such as the page ID, category and view time spent at the page. The attributes associated with each component are defined in the ATTRIBUTE dimension. The SESSION dimension indexes individual sessions. In the model, irregular sessions are converted to a regular data structure to which existing data mining algorithms can be applied while the order of the page sequences is maintained. A rich set of page attributes is embedded in the model for different analysis purposes. We also present some experimental results of using the partitional clustering algorithm to cluster sessions. Because the sessions are essentially sequences of categories, the k-modes algorithm designed for clustering categorical data and the clustering method using the Markov transition frequency (or probability) matrix, are used to cluster categorical sequences.

Instead of direct prediction of a continuous output variable, the method discretizes the variable by k-means clustering and solves the resultant classification problem. Predictions on new examples are made by averaging the mean values of classes with votes that are close in number to the most likely class. We provide experimental evidence that this indirect approach can often yield strong results for many applications, generally outperforming direct approaches such as regression trees and rivaling bagged regression trees.

We propose using a robust space transformation called the Donoho-Stahel estimator. In the first half of the paper, we show the key properties of the estimator. Of particular importance to KDD applications involving databases is the stability property, which says that in spite of frequent updates, the estimator does not: (a) change much, (b) lose its usefulness, or (c) require re-computation. In the second half, we focus on the computation of the estimator for high-dimensional databases. We develop randomized algorithms and evaluate how well they perform empirically. The novel algorithm we develop called the Hybrid-random algorithm is, in most cases, at least an order of magnitude faster than the Fixed-angle and Subsampling algorithms."

The most typical type would be a database of point objects. Records of the objects may consist of ""requested service name,"" ""number of packet transmitted"" in addition to x and y coordinate values indicating where the request came from. The algorithm presented here efficiently finds sets of ""service names"" that were frequently close to each other in the spatial database. For example, it may find a frequent neighboring class set, where ""ticket"" and ""timetable"" are frequently requested close to each other. By recognizing this, location-based service providers can promote a ""ticket"" service for customers who access the ""timetable."""

We propose a novel approach to clustering, based on the deterministic analysis of random walks on a weighted graph generated from the data. Our approach can decompose the data into arbitrarily shaped clusters of different sizes and densities, overcoming noise and outliers that may blur the natural decomposition of the data. The method requires only O(n log n) time, and one of its variants needs only constant space.

This can be a very efficient, scalable and cost effective way to share knowledge. The effectiveness and cost savings are proportional to the utility of the information within the knowledge base and inversely proportional to the amount of labor required in maintaining the knowledge. To address this issue, we have developed an algorithm and methodology to increase the utility of the information within a knowledge base while greatly reducing the labor required.In this paper, we describe an implementation of an algorithm and methodology for comparing a knowledge base to a set of problem tickets to determine which categories and subcategories are not well addressed within the knowledge base. We utilize text clustering on problem ticket text to determine a set of problem categories. We then compare each knowledge base solution document to each problem category centroid using a cosine distance metric. The distance between the ""closest"" solution document and the corresponding centroid becomes the basis of that problem category's ""knowledge gap"". Our claim is that this gap metric serves as a useful method for quickly and automatically determining which problem categories have no relevant solutions in a knowledge base. We have implemented our approach, and we present the results of performing a knowledge gap analysis on a set of support center problem tickets."

In practice these expectations are often derived in an ad hoc manner. To address this unsupervised task, we combine nearest neighbor methods and classical statistical methods and derive a new solution to the classical econometric task of frontier analysis. We apply our methodology to two real world business problems in Verizon, a major telecommunications provider in the United States, more specifically in the print yellow page division Verizon Information Services: (1) identifying under marketed customers for targeted upselling campaigns and focused sales attention, and (2) benchmarking regional directory divisions to incent performance improvements. Our analysis uncovers some commercially useful aspects of these domains and by conservative estimates can increase revenue by several million dollars in each domain.

Star Coordinates is proposed as a new multi-dimensional visualization technique, which supports various interactions to stimulate visual thinking in early stages of knowledge discovery process. In Star Coordinates, coordinate axes are arranged on a two-dimensional surface, where each axis shares the same origin point. Each multi-dimensional data element is represented by a point, where each attribute of the data contributes to its location through uniform encoding. Interaction features of Star Coordinates provide users the ability to apply various transformations dynamically, integrate and separate dimensions, analyze correlations of multiple dimensions, view clusters, trends, and outliers in the distribution of data, and query points based on data ranges. Our experience with Star Coordinates shows that it is particularly useful for the discovery of hierarchical clusters, and analysis of multiple factors providing insight in various real datasets including telecommunications churn.

SVM induction algorithms build pattern classifiers by identifying a maximal margin separating hyperplane from training examples in high dimensional pattern spaces or spaces induced by suitable nonlinear kernel transformations over pattern spaces. SVM have been demonstrated to be quite effective in a number of practical pattern classification tasks. Since the separating hyperplane is defined in terms of more than two variables it is necessary to use visual techniques that can navigate the viewer through high-dimensional spaces. We demonstrate the use of projection-based tour methods to gain useful insights into SVM classifiers with linear kernels on 8-dimensional data.

In order to maximize the revenue on a flight, the number of seats available for sale is typically higher than the physical seat capacity (overbooking). To optimize the overbooking rate, an accurate estimation of the number of no-show passengers (passengers who hold a valid booking but do not appear at the gate to board for the flight) is essential. Currently, no-shows on future flights are estimated from the number of no-shows on historical flights averaged on booking class level. In this work, classification trees and logistic regression models are applied to estimate the probability that an individual passenger turns out to be a no-show. Passenger information stored in the reservation system of the airline is either directly used as explanatory variable or used to create attributes that have an impact on the probability of a passenger to be a no-show. The total number of no-shows in each booking class or on the total flight is then obtained by accumulating the individual no-show probabilities over the entity of interest. We show that this forecasting approach is more accurate than the currently used method. In addition, the selected models lead to a deepened insight into passenger behavior.

In this paper, we describe a Web caching scheme that capitalizes on prefetching. Prefetching refers to the mechanism of deducing forthcoming page accesses of a client, based on access log information. Web log mining methods are exploited to provide effective prediction of Web-user accesses. The proposed scheme achieves a coordination between the two techniques (i.e., caching and prefetching). The prefetched documents are accommodated in a dedicated part of the cache, to avoid the drawback of incorrect replacement of requested documents. The requirements of the Web are taken into account, compared to the existing schemes for buffer management in database and operating systems. Experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed method compared to the previous ones, in terms of improvement in cache performance.

While building predictive models has been well studied, finding useful rules for action still presents a major problem. A main obstacle is that many data mining algorithms often produce too many rules. Existing research has shown that most of the discovered rules are actually redundant or insignificant. Pruning techniques have been developed to remove those spurious and/or insignificant rules. In this paper, we argue that being a significant rule (or a non-redundant rule), however, does not mean that it is a potentially useful rule for action. Many significant rules (unpruned rules) are in fact not actionable. This paper studies this issue and presents an efficient algorithm to identify these non-actionable rules. Experiment results on many real-life datasets show that the number of non-actionable rules is typically quite large. The proposed technique thus enables the user to focus on fewer rules and to be assured that the remaining rules are non-redundant and potentially useful for action.

Most traditional clustering algorithms are limited to handling datasets that contain either continuous or categorical attributes. However, datasets with mixed types of attributes are common in real life data mining problems. In this paper, we propose a distance measure that enables clustering data with both continuous and categorical attributes. This distance measure is derived from a probabilistic model that the distance between two clusters is equivalent to the decrease in log-likelihood function as a result of merging. Calculation of this measure is memory efficient as it depends only on the merging cluster pair and not on all the other clusters. Zhang et al [8] proposed a clustering method named BIRCH that is especially suitable for very large datasets. We develop a clustering algorithm using our distance measure based on the framework of BIRCH. Similar to BIRCH, our algorithm first performs a pre-clustering step by scanning the entire dataset and storing the dense regions of data records in terms of summary statistics. A hierarchical clustering algorithm is then applied to cluster the dense regions. Apart from the ability of handling mixed type of attributes, our algorithm differs from BIRCH in that we add a procedure that enables the algorithm to automatically determine the appropriate number of clusters and a new strategy of assigning cluster membership to noisy data. For data with mixed type of attributes, our experimental results confirm that the algorithm not only generates better quality clusters than the traditional k-means algorithms, but also exhibits good scalability properties and is able to identify the underlying number of clusters in the data correctly. The algorithm is implemented in the commercial data mining tool Clementine 6.0 which supports the PMML standard of data mining model deployment.

Most existing algorithms cluster documents and words separately but not simultaneously. In this paper we present the novel idea of modeling the document collection as a bipartite graph between documents and words, using which the simultaneous clustering problem can be posed as a bipartite graph partitioning problem. To solve the partitioning problem, we use a new spectral co-clustering algorithm that uses the second left and right singular vectors of an appropriately scaled word-document matrix to yield good bipartitionings. The spectral algorithm enjoys some optimality properties; it can be shown that the singular vectors solve a real relaxation to the NP-complete graph bipartitioning problem. We present experimental results to verify that the resulting co-clustering algorithm works well in practice.

In many applications, e.g., computational biology, an infrequent pattern is still considered very significant if its actual occurrence frequency exceeds the prior expectation by a large margin. The traditional metric, such as support, is not necessarily the ideal model to measure this kind of surprising patterns because it treats all patterns equally in the sense that every occurrence carries the same weight towards the assessment of the significance of a pattern regardless of the probability of occurrence. A more suitable measurement, information, is introduced to naturally value the degree of surprise of each occurrence of a pattern as a continuous and monotonically decreasing function of its probability of occurrence. This would allow patterns with vastly different occurrence probabilities to be handled seamlessly. As the accumulated degree of surprise of all repetitions of a pattern, the concept of information gain is proposed to measure the overall degree of surprise of the pattern within a data sequence. The bounded information gain property is identified to tackle the predicament caused by the violation of the downward closure property by the information gain measure and in turn provides an efficient solution to this problem. Empirical tests demonstrate the efficiency and the usefulness of the proposed model.

It is argued that these rules can discover useful interactions with numeric data that cannot be discovered directly using traditional association rules with discretization.

Techniques such as Boosting and Bagging have proven to be highly effective but require repeated resampling of the training data, making them inappropriate in a data mining context. The methods presented in this paper take advantage of plentiful data, building separate classifiers on sequential chunks of training points. These classifiers are combined into a fixed-size ensemble using a heuristic replacement strategy. The result is a fast algorithm for large-scale or streaming data that classifies as well as a single decision tree built on all the data, requires approximately constant memory, and adjusts quickly to concept drift.

Existing approaches include keyword-based search, wrapper-based information extraction, Web query and user preferences. These approaches essentially find information that matches the user's explicit specifications. This paper argues that this is insufficient. There is another type of information that is also of great interest, i.e., unexpected information, which is unanticipated by the user. Finding unexpected information is useful in many applications. For example, it is useful for a company to find unexpected information bout its competitors, e.g., unexpected services and products that its competitors offer. With this information, the company can learn from its competitors and/or design counter measures to improve its competitiveness. Since the number of pages of a typical commercial site is very large and there are also many relevant sites (competitors), it is very difficult for a human user to view each page to discover the unexpected information. Automated assistance is needed. In this paper, we propose a number of methods to help the user find various types of unexpected information from his/her competitors' Web sites. Experiment results show that these techniques are very useful in practice and also efficient.

Typically, the intensity functions are assumed to be piecewise constant. We therefore consider different ways of fitting intensity models to event sequence data. We start by considering a Bayesian approach using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with varying number of pieces. These methods can be used to produce posterior distributions on the intensity functions and they can also accomodate covariates. The drawback is that they are computationally intensive and thus are not very suitable for data mining applications in which large numbers of intensity functions have to be estimated. We consider dynamic programming approaches to finding the change points in the intensity functions. These methods can find the maximum likelihood intensity function in O(n2k) time for a sequence of n events and k different pieces of intensity. We show that simple heuristics can be used to prune the number of potential change points, yielding speedups of several orders of magnitude. The results of the improved dynamic programming method correspond very closely with the posterior averages produced by the MCMC methods.

In our case, ""unusually frequent"" involves estimates of the frequency of each item set divided by a baseline frequency computed as if items occurred independently. The focus is on obtaining reliable estimates of this measure of interestingness for all item sets, even item sets with relatively low frequencies. For example, in a medical database of patient histories, unusual item sets including the item ""patient death"" (or other serious adverse event) might hopefully be flagged with as few as 5 or 10 occurrences of the item set, it being unacceptable to require that item sets occur in as many as 0.1% of millions of patient reports before the data mining algorithm detects a signal. Similar considerations apply in fraud detection applications. Thus we abandon the requirement that interesting item sets must contain a relatively large fixed minimal support, and adopt a criterion based on the results of fitting an empirical Bayes model to the item set counts. The model allows us to define a 95% Bayesian lower confidence limit for the ""interestingness"" measure of every item set, whereupon the item sets can be ranked according to their empirical Bayes confidence limits. For item sets of size J > 2, we also distinguish between multi-item associations that can be explained by the observed J(J-1)/2 pairwise associations, and item sets that are significantly more frequent than their pairwise associations would suggest. Such item sets can uncover complex or synergistic mechanisms generating multi-item associations. This methodology has been applied within the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to databases of adverse drug reaction reports and within AT&T to customer international calling histories. We also present graphical techniques for exploring and understanding the modeling results."

Our distributed boosting algorithm can also be used as a parallel classification technique, where a massive database that cannot fit into main computer memory is partitioned into disjoint subsets for a more efficient analysis. In the proposed method, at each boosting round the classifiers are first learned from disjoint datasets and then exchanged amongst the sites. Finally the classifiers are combined into a weighted voting ensemble on each disjoint data set. The ensemble that is applied to an unseen test set represents an ensemble of ensembles built on all distributed sites. In experiments performed on four large data sets the proposed distributed boosting method achieved classification accuracy comparable or even slightly better than the standard boosting algorithm while requiring less memory and less computational time. In addition, the communication overhead of the distributed boosting algorithm is very small making it a viable alternative to the standard boosting for large-scale databases.

Unfortunately, the traditional Zipf distribution often fails to model them well. In this paper, we propose a new probability distribution, the Discrete Gaussian Exponential (DGX), to achieve excellent fits in a wide variety of settings; our new distribution includes the Zipf distribution as a special case. We present a statistically sound method for estimating the DGX parameters based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We applied DGX to a wide variety of real world data sets, such as sales data from a large retailer chain, us-age data from AT&T, and Internet clickstream data; in all cases, DGX fits these distributions very well, with almost a 99% correlation coefficient in quantile-quantile plots. Our algorithm also scales very well because it requires only a single pass over the data. Finally, we illustrate the power of DGX as a new tool for data mining tasks, such as outlier detection.

For instance, NASA intends to design robots that are sufficiently autonomous to perform this task on planetary missions. Spectrometer readings provide one important source of data for identifying sites with minerals of interest. Reflectance spectrometers measure intensities of light reflected from surfaces over a range of wavelengths. Spectral intensity patterns may in some cases be sufficiently distinctive for proper identification of minerals or classes of minerals. For some mineral classes, carbonates for example, specific short spectral intervals are known to carry a distinctive signature. Finding similar distinctive spectral ranges for other mineral classes is not an easy problem. We propose and evaluate data-driven techniques that automatically search for spectral ranges optimized for specific minerals. In one set of studies, we partition the whole interval of wavelengths available in our data into sub-intervals, or bins, and use a genetic algorithm to evaluate a candidate selection of subintervals. As alternatives to this computationally expensive search technique, we present an entropy-based heuristic that gives higher scores for wavelengths more likely to distinguish between classes, as well as other greedy search procedures. Results are presented for four different classes, showing reasonable improvements in identifying some, but not all, of the mineral classes tested.

Common examples can be found in climate and image data sets, sensor data sets and medical data sets. The incompleteness in these data sets may arise from a number of factors: in some cases it may simply be a reflection of certain measurements not being available at the time; in others the information may be lost due to partial system failure; or it may simply be a result of users being unwilling to specify attributes due to privacy concerns. When a significant fraction of the entries are missing in all of the attributes, it becomes very difficult to perform any kind of reasonable extrapolation on the original data. For such cases, we introduce the novel idea of conceptual reconstruction, in which we create effective conceptual representations on which the data mining algorithms can be directly applied. The attraction behind the idea of conceptual reconstruction is to use the correlation structure of the data in order to express it in terms of concepts rather the original dimensions. As a result, the reconstruction procedure estimates only those conceptual aspects of the data which can be mined from the incomplete data set, rather than force errors created by extrapolation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a variety of real data sets.

In prior work we have developed SmartSifter, which is an on-line outlier detection algorithm based on unsupervised learning from data. On the basis of SmartSifter this paper yields a new framework for outlier filtering using both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques iteratively in order to make the detection process more effective and more understandable. The outline of the framework is as follows: In the first round, for an initial dataset, we run SmartSifter to give each data a score, with a high score indicating a high possibility of being an outlier. Next, giving positive labels to a number of higher scored data and negative labels to a number of lower scored data, we create labeled examples. Then we construct an outlier filtering rule by supervised learning from them. Here the rule is generated based on the principle of minimizing extended stochastic complexity. In the second round, for a new dataset, we filter the data using the constructed rule, then among the filtered data, we run SmartSifter again to evaluate the data in order to update the filtering rule. Applying of our framework to the network intrusion detection, we demonstrate that 1) it can significantly improve the accuracy of SmartSifter, and 2) outlier filtering rules can help the user to discover a general pattern of an outlier group.

Such models are commonly employed in the direct-mail industry; however, segmentation is often performed on an ad-hoc basis without directly considering how segmentation affects the accuracy of the resulting segment models.

The authors of 29 entries later wrote explanations of their work. This paper discusses these reports and reaches three main conclusions. First, naive Bayesian classifiers remain competitive in practice: they were used by both the winning entry and the next best entry. Second, identifying feature interactions correctly is important for maximizing predictive accuracy: this was the difference between the winning classifier and all others. Third and most important, too many researchers and practitioners in data mining do not appreciate properly the issue of statistical significance and the danger of overfitting. Given a dataset such as the one for the CoIL contest, it is pointless to apply a very complicated learning algorithm, or to perform a very time-consuming model search. In either ease, one is likely to overfit the training data and to fool oneself in estimating predictive accuracy and in discovering useful correlations.

Web data mining projects are concerned mainly with text mining, user segmentation, forecasting web usage and analyzing users' clickstream patterns. We present a new type of web usage mining called funnel analysis or funnel report mining. A funnel report is a study of the retention behavior among a series of pages or sites. For example, of all hits on the home page of www.msn.com, what percentages of those are followed by hits to moneycentral.msn.com? What percentage of www.msn.com hits are followed by moneycentral.msn.com, and then www.msnbc.com? What are the most interesting funnels starting with www.msn.com? Where does the greatest drop off rate occur after a user has hit MSNBC? Funnel reports are extremely useful in e-business because they give product planners an idea of how usable and well-structured their site is. From our experience performing web usage mining for the MSN network of sites, funnel reports are requested even more than user segmentation analyses, site affiliation studies and classification exercises. In this paper, we define a framework for funnel analysis and provide a tree-based solution we have been using successfully to extract all relevant funnels using only one scan of the data file.

We formulate two versions of the querying problem: the query selectivity estimation (i.e., finding exact counts for tuples in a data set) and the query generalization problem (i.e., computing the probability that a tuple will occur in new data). We show that frequent itemsets are useful for reducing the original data to a compressed representation and introduce a method to store them using an ADTree data structure. In an extension of our earlier work on this topic we propose several new schemes for query answering based on the compressed representation that avoid direct scans of the data at query time. Experimental results on real-world transaction data sets provide insights into various tradeoffs involving the offline time for model-building, the online time for query-answering, the memory footprint of the compressed data, and the accuracy of the estimate provided to the query.

The database consists of 43576 compounds, which were measured for their capability to protect human cells from HIV-1 infection. According to these measurements, the compounds were classified as either active, moderately active or inactive. The distribution of classes is extremely skewed: Only 1.3 % of the molecules is known to be active, and 2.7 % is known to be moderately active.Given this database, we were interested in molecular substructures (i.e., features) that are frequent in the active molecules, and infrequent in the inactives. In data mining terms, we focused on features with a minimum support in active compounds and a maximum support in inactive compounds. We analyzed the database using the levelwise version space algorithm that forms the basis of the inductive query and database system MOLFEA (Molecular Feature Miner). Within this framework, it is possible to declaratively specify the features of interest, such as the frequency of features on (possibly different) datasets as well as on the generality and syntax of them. Assuming that the detected substructures are causally related to biochemical mechanisms, it should be possible to facilitate the development of new pharmaceuticals with improved activities.

Through WUM, we are able to gain a better understanding of both the web and web user access patterns; a knowledge that is crucial for realization of full economic potential of the web. In this chapter, we describe a framework for WUM that particularly satisfies the challenging requirements of the web personalization applications. For on-line and anonymous web personalization to be effective, WUM must be accomplished in real-time as accurately as possible. On the other hand, the analysis tier of the WUM system should allow compromise between scalability and accuracy to be applicable to real-life web-sites with numerous visitors. Within our WUM framework, we introduce a distributed user tracking approach for accurate, efficient, and scalable collection of the usage data. We also propose a new model, the Feature Matrices (FM) model, to capture and analyze users access patterns. With FM, various features of the usage data can be captured with flexible precision so that we can trade off accuracy for scalability based on the specific application requirements. Moreover, due to low update complexity of the model, FM can adapt to user behavior changes in real-time. Finally, we define a novel similarity measure based on FM that is specifically designed for accurate classification of partial navigation patterns in real-time. Our extensive experiments with both synthetic and real data verify correctness and efficacy of our WUM framework for efficient web personalization.

It is a difficult problem because of the inherently high dimensionality of the data. The most promising solutions involve performing dimensionality reduction on the data, then indexing the reduced data with a multidimensional index structure. Many dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed, including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Piecewise Polynomial Approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for using ensembles of two or more representations for more efficient indexing. The basic idea is that instead of committing to a single representation for an entire dataset, different representations are chosen for indexing different parts of the database. The representations are chosen based upon a local view of the database. For example, sections of the data that can achieve a high fidelity representation with wavelets are indexed as wavelets, but highly spectral sections of the data are indexed using the Fourier transform. At query time, it is necessary to search several small heterogeneous indices, rather than one large homogeneous index. As we will theoretically and empirically demonstrate this results in much faster query response times.

Unfortunately, most of the large databases available for mining today violate this assumption. They were gathered over months or years, and the underlying processes generating them changed during this time, sometimes radically. Although a number of algorithms have been proposed for learning time-changing concepts, they generally do not scale well to very large databases. In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm for mining decision trees from continuously-changing data streams, based on the ultra-fast VFDT decision tree learner. This algorithm, called CVFDT, stays current while making the most of old data by growing an alternative subtree whenever an old one becomes questionable, and replacing the old with the new when the new becomes more accurate. CVFDT learns a model which is similar in accuracy to the one that would be learned by reapplying VFDT to a moving window of examples every time a new example arrives, but with O(1) complexity per example, as opposed to O(w), where w is the size of the window. Experiments on a set of large time-changing data streams demonstrate the utility of this approach.

Organizations conducting Electronic Commerce (e-commerce) can greatly benefit from the insight that data mining of transactional and clickstream data provides. Such insight helps not only to improve the electronic channel (e.g., a web site), but it is also a learning vehicle for the bigger organization conducting business at brick-and-mortar stores. The e-commerce site serves as an early alert system for emerging patterns and a laboratory for experimentation. For successful data mining, several ingredients are needed and e-commerce provides all the right ones (the Good). Web server logs, which are commonly used as the source of data for mining e-commerce data, were designed to debug web servers, and the data they provide is insufficient, requiring the use of heuristics to reconstruct events. Moreover, many events are never logged in web server logs, limiting the source of data for mining (the Bad). Many of the problems of dealing with web server log data can be resolved by properly architecting the ecommerce sites to generate data needed for mining. Even with a good architecture, however, there are challenging problems that remain hard to solve (the Ugly). Lessons and metrics based on mining real e-commerce data are presented.

In these domains, both costs and probabilities are unknown for test examples, so both cost estimators and probability estimators must be learned. After discussing how to make optimal decisions given cost and probability estimates, we present decision tree and naive Bayesian learning methods for obtaining well-calibrated probability estimates. We then explain how to obtain unbiased estimators for example-dependent costs, taking into account the difficulty that in general, probabilities and costs are not independent random variables, and the training examples for which costs are known are not representative of all examples. The latter problem is called sample selection bias in econometrics. Our solution to it is based on Nobel prize-winning work due to the economist James Heckman. We show that the methods we propose perform better than MetaCost and all other known methods, in a comprehensive experimental comparison that uses the well-known, large, and challenging dataset from the KDD'98 data mining contest.

In addition, we provide experimental results from the application of our algorithms on a Minneapolis-St.Paul(Twin Cities) traffic dataset to show their effectiveness and usefulness.

The computer and telecommunication industries rely heavily on knowledge-based expert systems to manage the performance of their networks. These expert systems are developed by knowledge engineers, who must first interview domain experts to extract the pertinent knowledge. This knowledge acquisition process is laborious and costly, and typically is better at capturing qualitative knowledge than quantitative knowledge. This is a liability, especially for domains like the telecommunication domain, where enormous amounts of data are readily available for analysis. Data mining holds tremendous promise for the development of expert systems for monitoring network performance since it provides a way of automatically identifying subtle, yet important, patterns in data. This case study describes a project in which a temporal data mining system called Timeweaver is used to identify faulty telecommunication equipment from logs of network alarm messages.

It is based on the regularization network approach but, in contrast to other methods which employ ansatz functions associated to data points, we use a grid in the usually high-dimensional feature space for the minimization process. To cope with the curse of dimensionality, we employ sparse grids [49]. Thus, only O(hn-1nd-1) instead of O(hn-d) grid points and unknowns are involved. Here d denotes the dimension of the feature space and hn = 2-n gives the mesh size. We use the sparse grid combination technique [28] where the classification problem is discretized and solved on a sequence of conventional grids with uniform mesh sizes in each dimension. The sparse grid solution is then obtained by linear combination. In contrast to our former work, where d-linear functions were used, we now apply linear basis functions based on a simplicial discretization. This allows to handle more dimensions and the algorithm needs less operations per data point.We describe the sparse grid combination technique for the classification problem, give implementational details and discuss the complexity of the algorithm. It turns out that the method scales linearly with the number of given data points. Finally we report on the quality of the classifier built by our new method on data sets with up to 10 dimensions. It turns out that our new method achieves correctness rates which are competitive to that of the best existing methods.

Hence, models learned from such data may be subject to limitations, the nature of which has not been well studied. Understanding the limitations is particularly important since most current personalization techniques are based on site-centric data only. In this paper, we empirically examine the implications of learning from incomplete data in the context of two specific problems: (a) predicting if the remainder of any given session will result in a purchase and (b) predicting if a given user will make a purchase at any future session. For each of these problems we present new algorithms for fast and accurate data preprocessing of clickstream data. Based on a comprehensive experiment on user-level clickstream data gathered from 20,000 users' browsing behavior, we demonstrate that models built on user-centric data outperform models built on site-centric data for both prediction tasks.

They combine multiple learned base models with the aim of improving generalization performance. To date, they have been used primarily in batch mode, i.e., they require multiple passes through the training data. In previous work, we presented online bagging and boosting algorithms that only require one pass through the training data and presented experimental results on some relatively small datasets. Through additional experiments on a variety of larger synthetic and real datasets, this paper demonstrates that our online versions perform comparably to their batch counterparts in terms of classification accuracy. We also demonstrate the substantial reduction in running time we obtain with our online algorithms because they require fewer passes through the training data.

This framework views clustering as a general process of iterative optimization that includes modules for supervised learning and instance assignment. The framework has also suggested several novel clustering methods. In this paper, we investigate experimentally the efficacy of these algorithms and test some hypotheses about the relation between such unsupervised techniques and the supervised methods embedded in them.

This formulation, which can also be interpreted as regularized least squares and considered in the much more general context of regularized networks [8, 9], leads to an extremely fast and simple algorithm for generating a linear or nonlinear classifier that merely requires the solution of a single system of linear equations. In contrast, standard SVMs solve a quadratic or a linear program that require considerably longer computational time. Computational results on publicly available datasets indicate that the proposed proximal SVM classifier has comparable test set correctness to that of standard SVM classifiers, but with considerably faster computational time that can be an order of magnitude faster. The linear proximal SVM can easily handle large datasets as indicated by the classification of a 2 million point 10-attribute set in 20.8 seconds. All computational results are based on 6 lines of MATLAB code.

Using real web logs, we show that this application of data mining can achieve dramatic improvement to web-access performance.

Furthermore, since the algorithm is unsupervised, a set of concepts may be constructed for any corpus.

We show that these regularities exist in electronic markets for information goods, too, and that purchase incidence models provide a well founded theoretical base for recommender and alert services.

Here we propose a new algebraic method to separate disconnected and nearly-disconnected components. This method is based on spectral graph partitioning, following a key observation that disconnected components will show up, after properly sorted, as step-function like curve in the lowest eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix of the graph. Following an perturbative analysis framework, we systematically analyzed the graph structures, first on the disconnected subgraph case, and second on the effects of adding edges sparsely connecting different subgraphs as a perturbation. Several new results are derived, providing insights to spectral methods and related clustering objective function. Examples are given illustrating the concepts and results our methods. Comparing to the standard graph algorithms, this method has the same O(‖E ‖ + ‖V‖log(‖V‖)) complexity, but is easier to implement (using readily available eigensolvers). Further more the method can easily identify articulation points and bridges on nearly-disconnected graphs. Segmentation of a real example of Web graph for query amazon is given. We found that each disconnected or nearly-disconnected components forms a cluster on a clear topic.

Gene mapping aims at discovering a statistical connection from a particular disease or trait to a narrow region in the genome. In a typical case-control setting, data consists of genetic markers typed for a set of disease-associated chromosomes and a set of control chromosomes. A computer scientist would view this data as a set of strings.TreeDT extracts, essentially in the form of substrings and prefix trees, information about the historical recombinations in the population. This information is used to locate fragments potentially inherited from a common diseased founder, and to map the disease gene into the most likely such fragment. The method measures for each chromosomal location the disequilibrium of the prefix tree of marker strings starting from the location, to assess the distribution of disease-associated chromosomes.We evaluate experimentally the performance of TreeDT on realistic, simulated data sets, and comparisons to state of the art methods (TDT, HPM) show that TreeDT is very competitive.

Advances in image acquisition and storage technology have led to tremendous growth in significantly large and detailed image databases. These images, if analyzed, can reveal useful information to the human users. Image mining deals with the extraction of implicit knowledge, image data relationship, or other patterns not explicitly stored in the images. Image mining is more than just an extension of data mining to image domain. It is an interdisciplinary endeavor that draws upon expertise in computer vision, image processing, image retrieval, data mining, machine learning, database, and artificial intelligence. Despite the development of many applications and algorithms in the individual research fields cited above, research in image mining is still in its infancy. In this paper, we will examine the research issues in image mining, current developments in image mining, particularly, image mining frameworks, state-of-the-art techniques and systems. We will also identify some future research directions for image mining at the end of this paper.

Collaborative virtual environments are becoming an intrinsic part of professional practices. In addition to providing collaboration support, they have the potential to collect vast amounts of multimedia data about the actions and content of such collaborative activities. The aim of this research is to utilize this data effectively, extract meaningful insights out of it and feed discovered knowledge back into the environment. The paper presents a framework for integrating multimedia data mining techniques with collaborative virtual environments, starting from early conceptual development. Discovered patterns are deposited in an organisational memory, which makes these available within the virtual environment. Some of the ideas are illustrated by an example from the application to collaborative spaces developed in LiveNet, a virtual workspace design system.

We find that all three yield accurate forecasts of uncertain future events. In particular, prices of so-called ""movie stocks"" on HSX are good indicators of actual box office returns. Prices of HSX securities in Oscar, Emmy, and Grammy awards correlate well with observed frequencies of winning. FX prices are reliable indicators of future developments in science and technology. Collective predictions from players in the F1 competition serve as good forecasts of true race outcomes. In some cases, forecasts induced from game data are more reliable than expert opinions.

The data was encoded from text by a small team of specialists working to a well-defined protocol. The encoded data was analyzed using SOMs. Two exercises were conducted. These resulted in the linking of several offences in to clusters each of which were sufficiently similar to have possibly been committed by the same offender(s). A number of clusters were used to form profiles of offenders. Some of these profiles were confirmed by independent analysts as either belonging to known offenders or appeared sufficiently interesting to warrant further investigation.The prototype was developed over 10 weeks. This contrasts with an in-house study using a conventional approach, which took 2 years to reach similar results. As a consequence of this study the NCF intends to pursue an in-depth follow up study.

A signature database can then be used for data mining and to provide approximate answers to many kinds of queries about current customers quickly and accurately, as an empirical study of the calling patterns of 96,000 wireless customers who made about 18 million wireless calls over a three month period shows.

If the expected profit from a customer is greater than the cost of marketing to her, the marketing action for that customer is executed. So far, work in this area has considered only the intrinsic value of the customer (i.e, the expected profit from sales to her). We propose to model also the customer's network value: the expected profit from sales to other customers she may influence to buy, the customers those may influence, and so on recursively. Instead of viewing a market as a set of independent entities, we view it as a social network and model it as a Markov random field. We show the advantages of this approach using a social network mined from a collaborative filtering database. Marketing that exploits the network value of customers---also known as viral marketing---can be extremely effective, but is still a black art. Our work can be viewed as a step towards providing a more solid foundation for it, taking advantage of the availability of large relevant databases.

CoIL challenge 2000 was a supervised learning contest that attracted 43 entries. The authors of 29 entries later wrote explanations of their work. This paper discusses these reports and reaches three main conclusions. First, naive Bayesian classifiers remain competitive in practice: they were used by both the winning entry and the next best entry. Second, identifying feature interactions correctly is important for maximizing predictive accuracy: this was the difference between the winning classifier and all others. Third and most important, too many researchers and practitioners in data mining do not appreciate properly the issue of statistical significance and the danger of overfitting. Given a dataset such as the one for the CoIL contest, it is pointless to apply a very complicated learning algorithm, or to perform a very time-consuming model search. In either case, one is likely to overfit the training data and to fool oneself in estimating predictive accuracy and in discovering useful correlations.

Knowing what has changed is an important part of our lives. For businesses, recognizing changes is also crucial. It allows businesses to adapt themselves to the changing market needs. In this paper, we study changes of association rules from one time period to another. One approach is to compare the supports and/or confidences of each rule in the two time periods and report the differences. This technique, however, is too simplistic as it tends to report a huge number of rule changes, and many of them are, in fact, simply the snowball effect of a small subset of fundamental changes. Here, we present a technique to highlight the small subset of fundamental changes. A change is fundamental if it cannot be explained by some other changes. The proposed technique has been applied to a number of real-life datasets. Experiments results show that the number of rules whose changes are unexplainable is quite small (about 20% of the total number of changes discovered), and many of these unexplainable changes reflect some fundamental shifts in the application domain.

Theoretical results indicate that the method preserves distances quite nicely; however, empirical results are sparse. We present experimental results on using random projection as a dimensionality reduction tool in a number of cases, where the high dimensionality of the data would otherwise lead to burden-some computations. Our application areas are the processing of both noisy and noiseless images, and information retrieval in text documents. We show that projecting the data onto a random lower-dimensional subspace yields results comparable to conventional dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis: the similarity of data vectors is preserved well under random projection. However, using random projections is computationally significantly less expensive than using, e.g., principal component analysis. We also show experimentally that using a sparse random matrix gives additional computational savings in random projection.

According to guidance from the federal law and using six indicator variables of indemnity behavior, those entities equal to or exceeding 150% of the county mean (computed using a simple jackknife procedure) on all entity-relevant indicators were flagged as ""anomalous."" Log linear analysis was used to test (I) hierarchical node-node arrangements and (2) a non-recursive model of node information sharing. Chi-square distributed deviance statistic identified the optimal log linear model. The results of the applied data mining technique used here suggest that the non-recursive triplet and Agent-producer doublet collusion probabilistically accounts for the greatest proportion of waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal crop insurance program. Triplet and Agent-producer doublets need detailed investigation for possible collusion. Hence, this data mining technique provided a high level of confidence when 24 million records were quantitatively analyzed for possible fraud, waste, or other abuse of the crop insurance program administered by the USDA RMA, and suspect entities reported to USDA. This data mining technique can be applied where vast amounts of data are available to detect patterns of collusion or conspiracy as may be of interest to the criminal justice or intelligence agencies."

We present a general framework for characterizing learning in this context by deriving the Bayes error rate for this problem under a Markov assumption. The Bayes error framework demonstrates why certain patterns are much harder to discover than others. It also explains the role of different parameters such as pattern length and pattern frequency in sequential discovery. We demonstrate how the Bayes error can be used to calibrate existing discovery algorithms, providing a lower bound on achievable performance. We discuss a number of fundamental issues that characterize sequential pattern discovery in this context, present a variety of empirical results to complement and verify the theoretical analysis, and apply our methodology to real-world motif-discovery problems in computational biology."

Such data are usually in the form of very long strings for which it is difficult to determine the most relevant features for a classification task. For example, a typical DNA string may be millions of characters long, and there may be thousands of such strings in a database. In many cases, the classification behavior of the data may be hidden in the compositional behavior of certain segments of the string which cannot be easily determined apriori. Another problem which complicates the classification task is that in some cases the classification behavior is reflected in global behavior of the string, whereas in others it is reflected in local patterns. Given the enormous variation in the behavior of the strings over different data sets, it is useful to develop an approach which is sensitive to both the global and local behavior of the strings for the purpose of classification. For this purpose, we will exploit the multi-resolution property of wavelet decomposition in order to create a scheme which can mine classification characteristics at different levels of granularity. The resulting scheme turns out to be very effective in practice on a wide range of problems.

While this problem has attracted the attention of many researchers for many years, we are witnessing a resurgence of interest in new clustering techniques. In this paper we discuss some very recent clustering approaches and recount our experience with some of these algorithms. We also present the problem of clustering in the presence of constraints and discuss the issue of clustering validation.

ROCCH analysis, where accuracy and cost are intertwined in the solution space, was a revolutionary tool for two-class problems. We propose an alternative formulation, as an optimization problem, commonly used in Operations Research. This approach extends the ROCCH analysis to allow for locating optimal solutions while outside constraints are present. Similarly to the ROCCH analysis, we combine cost and class distribution while defining the objective function. Rather than focusing on slopes of the edges in the convex hull of the solution space, however, we treat cost as an objective function to be minimized over the solution space, by selecting the best performing classifier(s) (one or more vertex in the solution space). The Linear Programming framework provides a theoretical and computational methodology for finding the vertex (classifier) which minimizes the objective function.

This raises the question of how to integrate information from domain literature with statistical data. Because quantifying similarities or dependencies between variables is a basic building block in knowledge discovery, we consider here the following question. Which vector representations of text and which statistical scores of similarity or dependency support best the use of literature in statistical models? For the text source, we assume to have annotations for the domain variables as short free-text descriptions and optionally to have a large literature repository from which we can further expand the annotations. For evaluation, we contrast the variables similarities or dependencies obtained from text using different annotation sources and vector representations with those obtained from measurement data or expert assessments. Specifically, we consider two learning problems: clustering and Bayesian network learning. Firstly, we report performance (against an expert reference) for clustering yeast genes from textual annotations. Secondly, we assess the agreement between text-based and data-based scores of variable dependencies when learning Bayesian network substructures for the task of modeling the joint distribution of clinical measurements of ovarian tumors.

In most related studies, the dissimilarity between two clusters is defined as the distance between their centroids, or the distance between two closest (or farthest) data points. However, all of these measurements are vulnerable to outliers, and removing the outliers precisely is yet another difficult task. In view of this, we propose a new similarity measurement referred to as cohesion, to measure the inter-cluster distances. By using this new measurement of cohesion, we design a two-phase clustering algorithm, called cohesion-based self-merging (abbreviated as CSM), which runs in linear time to the size of input data set. Combining the features of partitional and hierarchical clustering methods, algorithm CSM partitions the input data set into several small subclusters in the first phase, and then continuously merges the subclusters based on cohesion in a hierarchical manner in the second phase. As shown by our performance studies, the cohesion-based clustering is very robust and possesses the excellent tolerance to outliers in various workloads. More importantly, algorithm CSM is shown to be able to cluster the data sets of arbitrary shapes very efficiently, and provide better clustering results than those by prior methods.Index Terms: Data mining, data clustering, hierarchical clustering, partitional clustering

GDT-RS (Generalized Distribution Table and Rough Set) is a soft hybrid induction system, and RSBR (Rough Sets with Boolean Reasoning) is used for discretization of real valued attributes as a preprocessing step realized before the GDT-RS starts. We argue that discretization of continuous valued attributes is an important pre-processing step in the rule discovery process. We illustrate the quality of rules discovered by GDT-RS is strongly affected by the result of discretization.

We prove that PSVM using a linear kernel is identical to ridge regression, a biased-regression method known in the statistical community for more than thirty years. Techniques from the statistical literature to estimate the tuning constant that appears in the SVM and PSVM framework are discussed. Better shrinkage strategies that incorporate more than one tuning constant are suggested. For nonlinear kernels, the minimization problem posed in the PSVM framework is equivalent to finding the posterior mode of a Bayesian model defined through a Gaussian process on the predictor space. Apart from providing new insights, these interpretations help us attach an estimate of uncertainty to our predictions and enable us to build richer classes of models. In particular, we propose a new algorithm called PSVMMIX which is a combination of ridge regression and a Gaussian process model. Extension to the case of continuous response is straightforward and illustrated with example datasets.

MDSAM examines sequences composed of several information types, such as visited pages and visiting time spent on pages. Besides, MDSAM handles large databases and uses heuristics to compute a multidimensional cost based on one-dimensional optimal trajectories. Empirical results show that MDSAM identifies profiles showing visited pages, visiting time spent on pages and the order in which pages are visited on a web site.

Several corpus based smoothing techniques have been proposed to address the data sparsity and synonym problems faced by information retrieval systems. Such smoothing techniques are often unable to discover and utilize the correlations among terms.We propose CVS, a Correlation-Verification based Smoothing method, that considers co-occurrence information in smoothing. Strongly correlated terms in a document are identified by their co-occurrence frequencies in the document. To avoid missing correlated terms with low co-occurrence frequencies but specific to the theme of the document, the joint distributions of terms in the document are compared with those in the corpus for statistical significance.A common approach to apply corpus based smoothing techniques to information retrieval is by refining the vector representations of documents. This paper investigates the effects of corpus based smoothing on information retrieval by query expansion using term clusters generated from a term clustering process. The results can also be viewed in light of the effects of smoothing on clustering.Empirical studies show that our approach outperforms previous corpus based smoothing techniques. It improves retrieval effectiveness by 14.6%. The results demonstrate that corpus based smoothing can be used for query expansion by term clustering.

We repeat well-known methods such as the Pearson method, but also address common problems of recommender systems, in particular the sparsity problem. The sparsity problem is the problem of having too few ratings and hence too few correlations between users. We address this problem in two different manners. First, we introduce “transitive correlations"", a mechanism to increase the number of correlations between existing users. Second, we add “agents"", artificial users that rate in accordance with some predefined preferences. We show that both ideas pay off, albeit in different ways: Transitive correlations provide a small help for virtually no price, whereas rating agents improve the coverage of the system significantly but also have a negative impact on the system performance."

Active customers contribute to the business goals of an organization, while passive customers are potential candidates that can be converted to active ones. Existing KDD techniques focused mainly on past data generated by active customers. The insights discovered apply well to active ones but may scale poorly with passive customers. This is because there is no attempt to generate know-how to convert passive customers into active ones. We propose an algorithm to discover relationship graphs using both types of profile. Using relationship graphs, an organization can be more effective in realizing its goals.

This paper introduces an efficient way to boost SVM. It embraces the idea of active learning to dynamically select “important” samples into training sample set for constructing base classifiers. This method maintains a small training sample set with settled size in order to control the complexity of each base classifier. Other than construct each base SVM classifier directly, it uses the training samples only for finding support vectors. This way to combine boosting and SVM is proved to be accurate and efficient by experimental results.

The use of intrusion detection has given rise to another difficult problem, namely the handling of a generally large number of alarms. In this paper, we mine historical alarms to learn how future alarms can be handled more efficiently. First, we investigate episode rules with respect to their suitability in this approach. We report the difficulties encountered and the unexpected insights gained. In addition, we introduce a new conceptual clustering technique, and use it in extensive experiments with real-world data to show that intrusion detection alarms can be handled efficiently by using previously mined knowledge.

Our approach Hyperbolic Multi-Dimensional Scaling (H-MDS) extends earlier work [7] using hyperbolic spaces for visualization of tree structures data ( ""hyperbolic tree browser"" ).By borrowing concepts from multi-dimensional scaling we map proximity data directly into the 2-dimensional hyperbolic space (H2). This removes the restriction to ""quasihierarchical"", graph-based data -- limiting previous work. Since a suitable distance function can convert all kinds of data to proximity (or distance-based) data this type of data can be considered the most general.We used the circular Poincaré model of the H2 which allows effective human-computer interaction: by moving the ""focus"" via mouse the user can navigate in the data without loosing the ""context"". In H2 the ""fish-eye"" behavior originates not simply by a non-linear view transformation but rather by extraordinary, non-Euclidean properties of the H2. Especially, the exponential growth of length and area of the underlying space makes the H2 a prime target for mapping hierarchical and (now also) high-dimensional data.We present several high-dimensional mapping examples including synthetic and real world data and a successful application for unstructured text. By analyzing and integrating multiple film critiques from news:rec.art.movies.reviews and the internet movie database, each movie becomes placed within the H2. Here the idea is, that related films share more words in their reviews than unrelated. Their semantic proximity leads to a closer arrangement. The result is a kind of high-level content structured display allowing the user to explore the ""space of movies""."

Unfortunately, the sheer size of these data sets has made efficient exploration of them impossible. To aid scientists in gleaning insight from their simulation data, we have developed an ad-hoc query infrastructure. Our system, called AQSim (short for Ad-hoc Queries for Simulation) reduces the data storage requirements and query access times in two stages. First, it creates and stores mathematical and statistical models of the data at multiple resolutions. Second, it evaluates queries on the models of the data instead of on the entire data set. In this paper, we present two simple but effective statistical modeling techniques for simulation data. Our first modeling technique computes the ""true"" (unbiased) mean of systematic partitions of the data. It makes no assumptions about the distribution of the data and uses a variant of the root mean square error to evaluate a model. Our second statistical modeling technique uses the Andersen-Darling goodness-of-fit method on systematic partitions of the data. This method evaluates a model by how well it passes the normality test on the data. Both of our statistical models effectively answer range queries. At each resolution of the data, we compute the precision of our answer to the user's query by scaling the one-sided Chebyshev Inequalities with the original mesh's topology. We combine precisions at different resolutions by calculating their weighted average. Our experimental evaluations on two scientific simulation data sets illustrate the value of using these statistical modeling techniques on multiple resolutions of large simulation data sets."

E-mail and news articles are two natural examples of such streams, each characterized by topics that appear, grow in intensity for a period of time, and then fade away. The published literature in a particular research field can be seen to exhibit similar phenomena over a much longer time scale. Underlying much of the text mining work in this area is the following intuitive premise --- that the appearance of a topic in a document stream is signaled by a ""burst of activity,"" with certain features rising sharply in frequency as the topic emerges.The goal of the present work is to develop a formal approach for modeling such ""bursts,"" in such a way that they can be robustly and efficiently identified, and can provide an organizational framework for analyzing the underlying content. The approach is based on modeling the stream using an infinite-state automaton, in which bursts appear naturally as state transitions; in some ways, it can be viewed as drawing an analogy with models from queueing theory for bursty network traffic. The resulting algorithms are highly efficient, and yield a nested representation of the set of bursts that imposes a hierarchical structure on the overall stream. Experiments with e-mail and research paper archives suggest that the resulting structures have a natural meaning in terms of the content that gave rise to them."

In this paper we present a framework for the evaluation of different aspects of recommender systems based on the process of discovering knowledge in databases introduced by Fayyad et al. and we summarize research already done in this area. One aspect identified in the presented evaluation framework is widely neglected when dealing with recommender algorithms. This aspect is to evaluate how useful patterns extracted by recommender algorithms are to support the social process of recommending products to others, a process normally driven by recommendations by peers or experts. To fill this gap for recommender algorithms based on frequent itemsets extracted from usage data we evaluate the usefulness of two algorithms. The first recommender algorithm uses association rules, and the other algorithm is based on the repeat-buying theory known from marketing research. of usage data from an educational Internet information broker and compare useful recommendations identified by users from the target group of the broker (peers) with the recommendations produced by the algorithms. The results of the evaluation presented in this paper suggest that frequent itemsets from usage histories match the concept of useful recommendations expressed by peers with satisfactory accuracy (higher than 70%) and precision (between 60% and 90%). Also the evaluation suggests that both algorithms studied in the paper perform similar on real-world data if they are tuned properly.

Existing supervised learning algorithms to automatically classify text need sufficient labeled documents to learn accurately. Applying the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to this problem is an alternative approach that utilizes a large pool of unlabeled documents to augment the available labeled documents. Unfortunately, the time needed to learn with these large unlabeled documents is too high. This paper introduces a novel parallel learning algorithm for text classification task. The parallel algorithm is based on the combination of the EM algorithm and the naive Bayes classifier. Our goal is to improve the computational time in learning and classifying process. We studied the performance of our parallel algorithm on a large Linux PC cluster called PIRUN Cluster. We report both timing and accuracy results. These results indicate that the proposed parallel algorithm is capable of handling large document collections.

This paper explores two practical issues in DC: (1) each document has its context of discussion, and (2) both the content and vocabulary of the document database is intrinsically evolving. The issues call for adaptive document classification (ADC) that adapts a DC system to the evolving contextual requirement of each document category, so that input documents may be classified based on their contexts of discussion. We present an incremental context mining technique to tackle the challenges of ADC. Theoretical analyses and empirical results show that, given a text hierarchy, the mining technique is efficient in incrementally maintaining the evolving contextual requirement of each category. Based on the contextual requirements mined by the system, higher-precision DC may be achieved with better efficiency.

Practical issues are how to select the type of kernel including any parameters and how to deal with the computational issues caused by the fact that the kernel matrix grows quadratically with the data. Inspired by ensemble and boosting methods like MART, we propose the Multiple Additive Regression Kernels (MARK) algorithm to address these issues. MARK considers a large (potentially infinite) library of kernel matrices formed by different kernel functions and parameters. Using gradient boosting/column generation, MARK constructs columns of the heterogeneous kernel matrix (the base hypotheses) on the fly and then adds them into the kernel ensemble. Regularization methods such as used in SVM, kernel ridge regression, and MART, are used to prevent overfitting. We investigate how MARK is applied to heterogeneous kernel ridge regression. The resulting algorithm is simple to implement and efficient. Kernel parameter selection is handled within MARK. Sampling and ""weak"" kernels are used to further enhance the computational efficiency of the resulting additive algorithm. The user can incorporate and potentially extract domain knowledge by restricting the kernel library to interpretable kernels. MARK compares very favorably with SVM and kernel ridge regression on several benchmark datasets."

Adaptive Generalized Estimation Equation (AGEE) approaches with Gibbs sampling under Bayesian framework and adaptive Bayes classifiers based on the estimations of AGEE models which uses modified Naive Bayes algorithm are proposed. The proposed classifiers have several important features. Firstly, it accounts for the correlation among the outputs and the indeterministic subjective noise into the estimation of parameters. Secondly, it reduces the number of attributes used to predict the class. Moreover, it drops the assumption of independence made by the Naive Bayes classifier. We apply our techniques to the problem of assigning jobs to Navy officers, with the goal of enhancing happiness for both the Navy and the officers.

Traditional classifiers perform badly when test data are not as complete as the training data because they tailor a training database too much. We introduce the concept of one rule set being more robust than another, that is, able to make more accurate predictions on test data with missing attribute values. We show that the optimal class association rule set is as robust as the complete class association rule set. We then introduce the k-optimal rule set, which provides predictions exactly the same as the optimal class association rule set on test data with up to k missing attribute values. This leads to a hierarchy of k-optimal rule sets in which decreasing size corresponds to decreasing robustness, and they all more robust than a traditional classification rule set. We introduce two methods to find k-optimal rule sets, i.e. an optimal association rule mining approach and a heuristic approximate approach. We show experimentally that a k-optimal rule set generated by the optimal association rule mining approach performs better than that by the heuristic approximate approach and both rule sets perform significantly better than a typical classification rule set (C4.5Rules) on incomplete test data.

We present a two-party algorithm for efficiently discovering frequent itemsets with minimum support levels, without either site revealing individual transaction values.

The main advantage of microarray technique is it allows simultaneous studies of the expressions of thousands of genes in a single experiment. Analyzing the microarray data is a challenge that arises the applications of various clustering methods used for data mining. Although a number of clustering methods have been proposed, they can not meet the requirements of automation, high quality and high efficiency at the same time in analyzing gene expression data. In this paper, we propose an automatic and efficient clustering approach for mining gene expression data produced via microarray techniques. Through performance experiments on real data sets, the proposed method is shown to achieve higher efficiency, clustering quality and automation than other clustering methods.

The difficulty is that the profit of one item not only comes from its own sales, but also from its influence on the sales of other items, i.e., the ""cross-selling effect"". In this paper, we draw an analogy between this influence and the mutual reinforcement of hub/authority web pages. Based on this analogy, we present a novel approach to the item ranking problem.We apply this ranking approach to solve two selection problems. In size-constrained selection, the maximum number of items that can be selected is fixed. In cost-constrained selection, there is no maximum number of items to be selected, but there is some cost associated with the selection of each item. In both cases, the question is what items should be selected to maximize the profit. Empirically, we show that this method finds profitable items in the presence of cross-selling effect."

This paper presents new methods for automatically integrating, summarizing and evaluating multimedia knowledge. These are essential for multimedia applications to efficiently and coherently deal with multimedia knowledge at different abstraction levels such as perceptual and semantic knowledge (e.g., image clusters and word senses, respectively). The proposed methods include automatic techniques (1) for interrelating the concepts in the multimedia knowledge using probabilistic Bayesian learning, (2) for reducing the size of multimedia knowledge by clustering the concepts and collapsing the relationships among the clusters, and (3) for evaluating the quality of multimedia knowledge using notions from information and graph theory. Experiments show the potential of knowledge integration techniques for improving the knowledge quality, the importance of good concept distance measures for clustering and summarizing knowledge, and the usefulness of automatic measures for comparing the effects of different processing techniques on multimedia knowledge.

Our research seeks to put it on a firmer footing by mining these networks from data, building probabilistic models of them, and using these models to choose the best viral marketing plan. Knowledge-sharing sites, where customers review products and advise each other, are a fertile source for this type of data mining. In this paper we extend our previous techniques, achieving a large reduction in computational cost, and apply them to data from a knowledge-sharing site. We optimize the amount of marketing funds spent on each customer, rather than just making a binary decision on whether to market to him. We take into account the fact that knowledge of the network is partial, and that gathering that knowledge can itself have a cost. Our results show the robustness and utility of our approach.

In this paper, we adopt an anomaly detection approach by detecting possible intrusions based on user profiles built from normal usage data. In particular, user profiles based on Unix shell commands are modeled using two different types of behavioral models. The dynamic modeling approach is based on hidden Markov models (HMM) and the principle of maximum likelihood, while the static modeling approach is based on event occurrence frequency distributions and the principle of minimum cross entropy. The novelty detection approach is adopted to estimate the model parameters using normal training data only. To determine whether a certain behavior is similar enough to the normal model and hence should be classified as normal, we use a scheme that can be justified from the perspective of hypothesis testing. Our experimental results show that static modeling outperforms dynamic modeling for this application. Moreover, the static modeling approach based on cross entropy is similar in performance to instance-based learning reported previously by others for the same dataset but with much higher computational and storage requirements than our method.

SyMP represents each data point by an Integrate-and-Fire oscillator and uses the relative similarity between the points to model the interaction between the oscillators. SyMP is robust to noise and outliers, determines the number of clusters in an unsupervised manner, identifies clusters of arbitrary shapes, and can handle very large data sets. The robustness of SyMP is an intrinsic property of the synchronization mechanism. To determine the optimum number of clusters, SyMP uses a dynamic resolution parameter. To identify clusters of various shapes, SyMP models each cluster by multiple Gaussian components. The number of components is automatically determined using a dynamic intra-cluster resolution parameter. Clusters with simple shapes would be modeled by few components while clusters with more complex shapes would require a larger number of components. The scalable version of SyMP uses an efficient incremental approach that requires a simple pass through the data set. The proposed clustering approach is empirically evaluated with several synthetic and real data sets, and its performance is compared with CURE.

The data available in these public markets offer interesting opportunities to study Internet auctions. We explore techniques for identifying common bidding patterns on eBay using data from eBay video game console auctions. The analysis reveals that there are certain bidding behaviors that appear frequently in the data, some of which have been previously identified and others which are new. We propose new attributes of bidding engagements and rules for classifying strategies. In addition, we suggest economic motivations that might lead to the identified behaviors. We then apply a clustering algorithm to look at each bidder’s behavior across several engagements, and find a few natural clusters. Finally, we apply association rule analysis to the data and find cases of likely shill behavior, but find no cross-correlation with any particular bidding behavior.

Response Models	The banking industry regularly mounts campaigns to improve customer value by offering new products to existing customers. In recent years this approach has gained significant momentum because of the increasing availability of customer data and the improved analysis capabilities in data mining. Typically, response models based on historical data are used to estimate the probability of a customer purchasing an additional product and the expected return from that additional purchase. Even with these computational improvements and accurate models of customer behavior, the problem of efficiently using marketing resources to maximize the return on marketing investment is a challenge. This problem is compounded because of the capability to launch multiple campaigns through several distribution channels over multiple time periods. The combination of alternatives creates a complicated array of possible actions. This paper presents a solution that answers the question of what products, if any, to offer to each customer in a way that maximizes the marketing return on investment. The solution is an improvement over the usual approach of picking the customers that have the largest expected value for a particular product because it is a global maximization from the viewpoint of the bank and allows for the effective implementation of business constraints across customers and business units. The approach accounts for limited resources, multiple sequential campaigns, and other business constraints. Furthermore, the solution provides insight into the cost of these constraints, in terms of decreased profits, and thus is an effective tool for both tactical campaign execution and strategic planning.

Remote Sensed Imagery (RSI) data is one of the promising application areas. Extracting interesting patterns and rules from datasets composed of images and associated ground data, can be of importance in precision agriculture, community planning, resource discovery and other areas. However, in most cases the image data sizes are too large to be mined in a reasonable amount of time using existing algorithms. In this paper, we propose an approach to derive association rules on RSI data using Peano Count Tree (P-tree) structure. P-tree structure, proposed in our previous work, provides a lossless and compressed representation of image data. Based on P-trees, an efficient association rule mining algorithm P-ARM with fast support calculation and significant pruning techniques are introduced to improve the efficiency of the rule mining process. P-ARM algorithm is implemented and compared with FP-growth and Apriori algorithms. Experimental results showed that our algorithm is superior for association rule mining on RSI spatial data.

In this paper, we analyze boosting with respect to this basic condition on the base learner, to see if boosting ensures prediction of rarely occurring events with high recall and precision. First we show that a base learner can satisfy the required condition even for poor recall or precision levels, especially for very rare classes. Furthermore, we show that the intelligent weight updating mechanism in boosting, even in its strong cost-sensitive form, does not prevent cases where the base learner always achieves high precision but poor recall or high recall but poor precision, when mapped to the original distribution. In either of these cases, we show that the voting mechanism of boosting falls to achieve good overall recall and precision for the ensemble. In effect, our analysis indicates that one cannot be blind to the base learner performance, and just rely on the boosting mechanism to take care of its weakness. We validate our arguments empirically on variety of real and synthetic rare class problems. In particular, using AdaCost as the boosting algorithm, and variations of PNrule and RIPPER as the base learners, we show that if algorithm A achieves better recall-precision balance than algorithm B, then using A as the base learner in AdaCost yields significantly better performance than using B as the base learner.

In the area of data mining, there have been increased interest in these issues since the former is related to fraud detection, rare event discovery, etc., while the latter is related to event/trend by change detection, activity monitoring, etc. Specifically, it is important to consider the situation where the data source is non-stationary, since the nature of data source may change over time in real applications. Although in most previous work outlier detection and change point detection have not been related explicitly, this paper presents a unifying framework for dealing with both of them on the basis of the theory of on-line learning of non-stationary time series. In this framework a probabilistic model of the data source is incrementally learned using an on-line discounting learning algorithm, which can track the changing data source adaptively by forgetting the effect of past data gradually. Then the score for any given data is calculated to measure its deviation from the learned model, with a higher score indicating a high possibility of being an outlier. Further change points in a data stream are detected by applying this scoring method into a time series of moving averaged losses for prediction using the learned model. Specifically we develop an efficient algorithms for on-line discounting learning of auto-regression models from time series data, and demonstrate the validity of our framework through simulation and experimental applications to stock market data analysis.

Much research has been focused on improving the accuracy of Naïve Bayes via eager learning. In this paper, we propose a novel lazy learning algorithm, Selective Neighbourhood based Naïve Bayes (SNNB). SNNB computes different distance neighborhoods of the input new object, lazily learns multiple Naïve Bayes classifiers, and uses the classifier with the highest estimated accuracy to make decision. The results of our experiments on 26 datasets show that our proposed SNNB algorithm is efficient and it outperforms Naïve Bayes, and state-of-the-art classification methods NBTree, CBA, and C4.5 in terms of accuracy.

This problem has been studied in information retrieval, machine learning and data mining. So far, many effective techniques have been proposed. However, most techniques are based on some underlying models and/or assumptions. When the data fits the model well, the classification accuracy will be high. However, when the data does not fit the model well, the classification accuracy can be very low. In this paper, we propose a refinement approach to dealing with this problem of model misfit. We show that we do not need to change the classification technique itself (or its underlying model) to make it more flexible. Instead, we propose to use successive refinements of classification on the training data to correct the model misfit. We apply the proposed technique to improve the classification performance of two simple and efficient text classifiers, the Rocchio classifier and the naïve Bayesian classifier. These techniques are suitable for very large text collections because they allow the data to reside on disk and need only one scan of the data to build a text classifier. Extensive experiments on two benchmark document corpora show that the proposed technique is able to improve text categorization accuracy of the two techniques dramatically. In particular, our refined model is able to improve the naïve Bayesian or Rocchio classifier's prediction performance by 45% on average.

Specifically, classifying Web pages of a user-interesting class is the first step of mining interesting information from the Web. However, constructing a classifier for an interesting class requires laborious pre-processing such as collecting positive and negative training examples. For instance, in order to construct a ""homepage"" classifier, one needs to collect a sample of homepages (positive examples) and a sample of non-homepages (negative examples). In particular, collecting negative training examples requires arduous work and special caution to avoid biasing them. We introduce in this paper the Positive Example Based Learning (PEBL) framework for Web page classification which eliminates the need for manually collecting negative training examples in pre-processing. We present an algorithm called Mapping-Convergence (M-C) that achieves classification accuracy (with positive and unlabeled data) as high as that of traditional SVM (with positive and negative data). Our experiments show that when the M-C algorithm uses the same amount of positive examples as that of traditional SVM, the M-C algorithm performs as well as traditional SVM."

We apply them to modeling the behavior of web site users, improving prediction in our PROTEUS architecture for personalizing web sites. We present experiments on an e-commerce and an academic web site showing that RMMs are substantially more accurate than alternative methods, and make good predictions even when applied to previously-unvisited parts of the site.

Different rules generated from almost the same training samples are against human intuition and complicate the process of decision making. In this paper, we present fundamental theorems for the instability problem of decision tree classifiers. The first theorem gives the relationship between a data change and the resulting tree structure change (i.e. split change). The second theorem, Instability Theorem, provides the cause of the instability problem. Based on the two theorems, algorithmic improvements can be made to lessen the instability problem. Empirical results illustrate the theorem statements. The trees constructed by the proposed algorithm are more stable, noise-tolerant, informative, expressive, and concise. Our proposed sensitivity measure can be used as a metric to evaluate the stability of splitting predicates. The tree sensitivity is an indicator of the confidence level in rules and the effective lifetime of rules.

In the presence of outliers, classical estimates of covariance and correlation matrices are not reliable. A small fraction of outliers, in some cases even a single outlier, can distort the classical covariance and correlation estimates making them virtually useless. That is, correlations for the vast majority of the data can be very erroneously reported; principal components transformations can be misleading; and multidimensional outlier detection via Mahalanobis distances can fail to detect outliers. There is plenty of statistical literature on robust covariance and correlation matrix estimates with an emphasis on affine-equivariant estimators that possess high breakdown points and small worst case biases. All such estimators have unacceptable exponential complexity in the number of variables and quadratic complexity in the number of observations. In this paper we focus on several variants of robust covariance and correlation matrix estimates with quadratic complexity in the number of variables and linear complexity in the number of observations. These estimators are based on several forms of pairwise robust covariance and correlation estimates. The estimators studied include two fast estimators based on coordinate-wise robust transformations embedded in an overall procedure recently proposed by [14]. We show that the estimators have attractive robustness properties, and give an example that uses one of the estimators in the new Insightful Miner data mining product.

In this paper, we propose to use association rule discovery methods for determining associations among expression levels of different genes. One of the main problems related to the discovery of these associations is the scalability issue. Microarrays usually contain very large numbers of genes that are sometimes measured in 10,000s. Therefore, analysis of such data can generate a very large number of associations that can often be measured in millions. The paper addresses this problem by presenting a method that enables biologists to evaluate these very large numbers of discovered association rules during the post-analysis stage of the data mining process. This is achieved by providing several rule evaluation operators, including rule grouping, filtering, browsing, and data inspection operators, that allow biologists to validate multiple individual gane regulation patterns at a time. By iteratively applying these operators, biologists can explore a significant part of all the initially generated rules in an acceptable period of time and thus answer biological questions that are of a particular interest to him or her. To validate our method, we tested our system on the microarray data pertaining to the studies of environmental hazards and their influence of gane expression processes. As a result, we managed to answer several questions that were of interest to the biologists that had collected this data.

In this paper we describe techniques for clustering and matching identifier names that are both scalable and adaptive, in the sense that they can be trained to obtain better performance in a particular domain. An experimental evaluation on a number of sample datasets shows that the adaptive method sometimes performs much better than either of two non-adaptive baseline systems, and is nearly always competitive with the best baseline system.

5B380174	Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	srinivasan parthasarathy + hui yang	2002	On the Use of Constrained Associations for Web Log Mining	association rule + association rule mining		In recent years there has been an increasing interest and a growing body of work in web usage mining as an underlying approach to capture and model the behavior of users on the web for business intelligence and browser performance enhancements. Web usage mining strategies range from strategies such as clustering and collaborative filtering, to accurately modeling sequential pattern navigation. However, many of these approaches suffer problems in terms of scalability and performance (especially online performance) due to the size and sparse nature of the data involved and the fact that many of the methods generate complex models that are less than amenable to an on-line decision making environment. In this paper, we present a new approach for mining web logs. Our approach discovers association rules that are constrained (and ordered) temporally. The approach relies on the simple premise that pages accessed recently have a greater influence on pages that will be accessed in the near future. The approach not only results in better predictions, it also prunes the rule-space significantly, thus enabling faster online prediction. Further refinements based on sequential dominance are also evaluated, and prove to be quite effective. Detailed experimental evaluation shows how the approach is quite effective in capturing a web user’s access patterns; consequently, our prediction model not only has good prediction accuracy, but also is more efficient in terms of space and time complexity. The approach is also likely to generalize for e-commerce recommendation systems.

In this paper we propose a new approach which addresses this problem in two stages: 1) using a supervised learning algorithm to classify the on-line document stream into pre-defined broad topic categories, and 2) performing topic-conditioned novelty detection for documents in each topic. We also focus on exploiting named-entities for event-level novelty detection and using feature-based heuristics derived from the topic histories. Evaluating these methods using a set of broadcast news stories, our results show substantial performance gains over the traditional one-level approach to the novelty detection problem.

Recent progress in data mining research has led to the development of numerous efficient and scalable methods for mining interesting patterns in large databases. In the mean time, recent progress in biology, medical science, and DNA technology has led to the accumulation of tremendous amounts of bio-medical data that demands for in-depth analysis. The question becomes how to bridge the two fields, data mining and bioinformatics, for successful mining of bio-medical data. In this abstract, we analyze how data mining may help bio-medical data analysis and outline some research problems that may motivate the further developments of data mining tools for bio-data analysis.

We depict how they can accurately capture the user's perception of similarity in high-dimensional data for visualization purposes. Moreover, we exploit the low-dimensional mapping provided by these embeddings, to develop new classification techniques, and we show experimentally that the classification accuracy is comparable (albeit using fewer dimensions) to a number of other classification procedures.

Any reengineering effort has to be aware of the functional requirements of the subject system, in order not to violate the integrity of its intended uses. However, as software systems get regularly maintained throughout their lifecycle, the documentation of their requirements often become obsolete or get lost. To address this problem of ""software requirements loss"", we have developed an interaction-pattern mining method for the recovery of functional requirements as usage scenarios. Our method analyzes traces of the run-time system-user interaction to discover frequently recurring patterns; these patterns correspond to the functionality currently exercised by the system users, represented as usage scenarios. The discovered scenarios provide the basis for reengineering the software system into web-accessible components, each one supporting one of the discovered scenarios. In this paper, we describe IPM2, our interaction-pattern discovery algorithm, we illustrate it with a case study from a real application and we give an overview of the reengineering process in the context of which it is employed."

A key prerequisite for such services is the modeling of user behavior and a natural starting place for this are Web logs. In this paper we propose a model for predicting sequences of user accesses which is distinguished by two elements: it is customizable and it reflects sequentiality. Customizable, in this context, means that the proposed model can be adapted to the characteristics of the server to more accurately capture its behavior. The concept of sequentiality in our model consists of three elements: (1) preservation of the sequence of the click stream in the antecedent, (2) preservation of the sequence of the click stream in the consequent and (3) a measure of the gap between the antecedent and the consequent in terms of the number of user clicks.

Specifically, the causality rule explored in this paper consists of a sequence of triggering events and a set of consequential events, and is designed with the capability of mining non-sequential, inter-transaction information. Hence, the causality rule mining provides a very general framework for rule derivation. Note, however, that the procedure of causality rule mining is very costly particularly in the presence of a huge number of candidate sets and a distributed database, and in our opinion, cannot be dealt with by direct extensions from existing rule mining methods. Consequently, we devise in this paper a series of level matching algorithms, including Level Matching (abbreviatedly as LM), Level Matching with Selective Scan (abbreviatedly as LMS), and Distributed Level Matching (abbreviatedly as Distibuted LM), to minimize the computing cost needed for the distributed data mining of causality rules. In addition, the phenomena of time window constraints are also taken into consideration for the development of our algorithms. As a result of properly employing the technologies of level matching and selective scan, the proposed algorithms present good efficiency and scalability in the mining of local and global causality rules. Scale-up experiments show that the proposed algorithms scale well with the number of sites and the number of customer transactions.Index Terms: knowledge discovery, distributed data mining causality rules, triggering events, consequential events

This is significant for many applications such as image classification where obtaining classification labels is expensive, while large unlabeled examples are easily available. We investigate an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled data. The reason why unlabeled data boosts learning accuracy is because it provides the information about the joint probability distribution. A theoretical argument shows that the more unlabeled examples are combined in learning, the more accurate the result. We then introduce B-EM algorithm, based on the combination of EM with bootstrap method, to exploit the large unlabeled data while avoiding prohibitive I/O cost. Experimental results over both synthetic and real data sets that the proposed approach has a satisfactory performance.

It is, however, very costly to collect and analyze survey data manually. This paper presents a new framework for mining product reputations on the Internet. It automatically collects people's opinions about target products from Web pages, and it uses text mining techniques to obtain the reputations of those products.On the basis of human-test samples, we generate in advance syntactic and linguistic rules to determine whether any given statement is an opinion or not, as well as whether such any opinion is positive or negative in nature. We first collect statements regarding target products using a general search engine, and then, using the rules, extract opinions from among them and attach three labels to each opinion, labels indicating the positive/negative determination, the product name itself, and an numerical value expressing the degree of system confidence that the statement is, in fact, an opinion. The labeled opinions are then input into an opinion database.The mining of reputations, i.e., the finding of statistically meaningful information included in the database, is then conducted. We specify target categories using label values (such as positive opinions of product A) and perform four types of text mining: extraction of 1) characteristic words, 2) co-occurrence words, 3) typical sentences, for individual target categories, and 4) correspondence analysis among multiple target categories.Actual marketing data is used to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the framework, which offers a drastic reduction in the overall cost of reputation analysis over that of conventional survey approaches and supports the discovery of knowledge from the pool of opinions on the web.

For example, metrics such as support, confidence, lift, correlation, and collective strength are often used to determine the interestingness of association patterns. However, many such measures provide conflicting information about the interestingness of a pattern, and the best metric to use for a given application domain is rarely known. In this paper, we present an overview of various measures proposed in the statistics, machine learning and data mining literature. We describe several key properties one should examine in order to select the right measure for a given application domain. A comparative study of these properties is made using twenty one of the existing measures. We show that each measure has different properties which make them useful for some application domains, but not for others. We also present two scenarios in which most of the existing measures agree with each other, namely, support-based pruning and table standardization. Finally, we present an algorithm to select a small set of tables such that an expert can select a desirable measure by looking at just this small set of tables.

Feature selection aims at the reduction of redundant features in a dataset whereas instance selection aims at the reduction of the number of instances. So far, these two methods have mostly been considered in isolation. In this paper, we present a new algorithm, which we call FIS (Feature and Instance Selection) that targets both problems simultaneously in the context of text classificationOur experiments on the Reuters and 20-Newsgroups datasets show that FIS considerably reduces both the number of features and the number of instances. The accuracy of a range of classifiers including Naïve Bayes, TAN and LB considerably improves when using the FIS preprocessed datasets, matching and exceeding that of Support Vector Machines, which is currently considered to be one of the best text classification methods. In all cases the results are much better compared to Mutual Information based feature selection. The training and classification speed of all classifiers is also greatly improved.

Their biggest weakness is that the knowledge they acquire is represented in a form not understandable to humans. Researchers tried to address this problem by extracting rules from trained Neural Networks. Most of the proposed rule extraction methods required specialized type of Neural Networks; some required binary inputs and some were computationally expensive. Craven proposed extracting MofN type Decision Trees from Neural Networks. We believe MofN type Decision Trees are only good for MofN type problems and trees created for regular high dimensional real world problems may be very complex. In this paper, we introduced a new method for extracting regular C4.5 like Decision Trees from trained Neural Networks. We showed that the new method (DecText) is effective in extracting high fidelity trees from trained networks. We also introduced a new discretization technique to make DecText be able to handle continuous features and a new pruning technique for finding simplest tree with the highest fidelity.

In the last decade there has been an explosion of interest in mining time series data. Literally hundreds of papers have introduced new algorithms to index, classify, cluster and segment time series. In this work we make the following claim. Much of this work has very little utility because the contribution made (speed in the case of indexing, accuracy in the case of classification and clustering, model accuracy in the case of segmentation) offer an amount of “improvement” that would have been completely dwarfed by the variance that would have been observed by testing on many real world datasets, or the variance that would have been observed by changing minor (unstated) implementation details. To illustrate our point, we have undertaken the most exhaustive set of time series experiments ever attempted, re-implementing the contribution of more than two dozen papers, and testing them on 50 real world, highly diverse datasets. Our empirical results strongly support our assertion, and suggest the need for a set of time series benchmarks and more careful empirical evaluation in the data mining community.

Our approach to generating summaries is based upon a data structure, associated with an attribute, called a domain generalization graph (DGG). A DGG for an attribute is a directed graph where each node represents a domain of values created by partitioning the original domain for the attribute, and each edge represents a generalization relation between these domains. Given a set of DGGs associated with a set of attributes, a generalization space can be defined as all possible combinations of domains, where one domain is selected from each DGG for each combination. This generalization space describes, then, all possible summaries consistent with the DGGs that can be generated from the selected attributes. When the number of attributes to be generalized is large or the DGGs associated with the attributes are complex, the generalization space can be very large, resulting in the generation of many summaries. The number of summaries can easily exceed the capabilities of a domain expert to identify interesting results. In this paper, we show that the Lorenz dominance order can be used to rank the summaries prior to presentation to the domain expert. The Lorenz dominance order defines a partial order on the summaries, in most cases, and in some cases, defines a total order. The rank order of the summaries represents an objective evaluation of their relative interestingness and provides the domain expert with a starting point for further subjective evaluation of the summaries.

In this paper for both exploring and prediction purposes a Time Lagged Recurrent Neural Network with trajectory learning is proposed for identifying and classifying the gene functional patterns from the heterogeneous nonlinear time series microarray experiments. The proposed procedures identify gene functional patterns from the dynamics of a state-trajectory learned in the heterogeneous time series and the gradient information over time. Also, the trajectory learning with Back-propagation through time algorithm can recognize gene expression patterns vary over time. This may reveal much more information about the regulatory network underlying gene expressions. The analyzed data were extracted from spotted DNA microarrays in the budding yeast expression measurements, produced by Eisen et al. The gene matrix contained 79 experiments over a variety of heterogeneous experiment conditions. The number of recognized gene patterns in our study ranged from two to ten and were divided into three cases. Optimal network architectures with different memory structures were selected based on Akaike and Bayesian information statistical criteria using two-way factorial design. The optimal model performance was compared to other popular gene classification algorithms such as Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and Self-Organized Map. The reliability of the performance was verified with multiple iterated runs.

The proposed architecture is built on top of a resource federation management layer and is composed of a set of different resources. We show how this architecture will behave during a typical KDD process design and deployment, how it enables the execution of complex and distributed data mining tasks with high performance and how it provides a community of e-scientists with means to collaborate, retrieve and reuse both KDD algorithms, discovery processes and knowledge in a visual analytical environment.

It trains two predictors in parallel, with each predictor labelling the unlabelled data for training the other predictor in the next round. Both predictors are support vector machines, one trained using data from the original feature space, the other trained with new features that are derived by clustering both the labelled and unlabelled data. Hence, unlike standard co-training methods, our method does not require a priori the existence of two redundant views either of which can be used for classification, nor is it dependent on the availability of two different supervised learning algorithms that complement each other.We evaluated our method with two classifiers and three text benchmarks: WebKB, Reuters newswire articles and 20 NewsGroups. Our evaluation shows that our co-training technique improves text classification accuracy especially when the number of labelled examples are very few.

In previous work, such ""distributional clustering"" of features has been found to achieve improvements over feature selection in terms of classification accuracy, especially at lower number of features [2, 28]. However the existing clustering techniques are agglomerative in nature and result in (i) sub-optimal word clusters and (ii) high computational cost. In order to explicitly capture the optimality of word clusters in an information theoretic framework, we first derive a global criterion for feature clustering. We then present a fast, divisive algorithm that monotonically decreases this objective function value, thus converging to a local minimum. We show that our algorithm minimizes the ""within-cluster Jensen-Shannon divergence"" while simultaneously maximizing the ""between-cluster Jensen-Shannon divergence"". In comparison to the previously proposed agglomerative strategies our divisive algorithm achieves higher classification accuracy especially at lower number of features. We further show that feature clustering is an effective technique for building smaller class models in hierarchical classification. We present detailed experimental results using Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines on the 20 Newsgroups data set and a 3-level hierarchy of HTML documents collected from Dmoz Open Directory."

This paper promotes the use of supervised machine learning in laboratory settings where chemists have a large number of samples to test for some property, and are interested in identifying as many positive instances for the least laboratory testing effort. Rather than traditional supervised learning where the chemists would first develop a large training set and then train a classifier, the paper promotes incrementally re-training from each lab test as it completes and then predicting the next best sample to test, as in the field of reinforcement learning. The method outperformed the 2001 KDD Cup thrombin competition winner, partly due to its reduced risk to concept drift from training set to test set.

These data can contain information that explicitly identifies the individual (e.g., social security number). Data can also contain other kinds of personal information (e.g., date of birth, zip code, gender) that are potentially identifying when linked with other available data sets. Data are often shared for business or legal reasons. This paper addresses the important issue of preserving the anonymity of the individuals or entities during the data dissemination process. We explore preserving the anonymity by the use of generalizations and suppressions on the potentially identifying portions of the data. We extend earlier works in this area along various dimensions. First, satisfying privacy constraints is considered in conjunction with the usage for the data being disseminated. This allows us to optimize the process of preserving privacy for the specified usage. In particular, we investigate the privacy transformation in the context of data mining applications like building classification and regression models. Second, our work improves on previous approaches by allowing more flexible generalizations for the data. Lastly, this is combined with a more thorough exploration of the solution space using the genetic algorithm framework. These extensions allow us to transform the data so that they are more useful for their intended purpose while satisfying the privacy constraints.

There is an increasing demand for automated systems that can analyze complex medical images and extract meaningful information for mining patterns. Here, we describe a real-life image mining application to the problem of tumour cell counting. The quantitative analysis of tumour cells is fundamental to characterizing the activity of tumour cells. Existing approaches are mostly manual, time-consuming and subjective. Efforts to automate the process of cell counting have largely focused on using image processing techniques only. Our studies indicate that image processing alone is unable to give accurate results. In this paper, we examine the use of extracted features rules to aid in the process of tumor cell counting. We propose a robust local adaptive thresholding and dynamic water immersion algorithms to segment regions of interesting from background. Meaningful features are then extracted from the segmented regions. A number of base classifiers are built to generate features rules to help identify the tumor cell. Two voting strategies are implemented to combine the base classifiers into a meta-classifier. Experiment results indicate that this process of using extracted features rules to help identify tumor cell leads to better accuracy than pure image processing techniques alone.

Often, severe feature selection is performed to limit the number of attributes to a manageable size, which unfortunately can lead to a loss of useful information. Feature space reduction may well be necessary for many stand-alone classifiers, but recent advances in the area of ensemble classifier techniques indicate that overall accurate classifier aggregates can be learned even if each individual classifier operates on incomplete ""feature view"" training data, i.e., such where certain input attributes are excluded. In fact, by using only small random subsets of features to build individual component classifiers, surprisingly accurate and robust models can be created. In this work we demonstrate how these types of architectures effectively reduce the feature space for submodels and groups of sub-models, which lends itself to efficient sequential and/or parallel implementations. Experiments with a randomized version of Adaboost are used to support our arguments, using the text classification task as an example."

Often a rule mining system generates a large number of rules and only a small subset of them is really useful in applications. Although there exist some systems allowing the user to query the discovered rules, they are less suitable for complex ad hoc querying of multiple data mining rulebases to retrieve interesting rules. In this paper, we propose a new powerful rule query language Rule-QL for querying multiple rulebases that is modeled after SQL and has rigorous theoretical foundations of a rule-based calculus. In particular, we first propose a rule-based calculus RC based on the first-order logic, and then present the language Rule-QL that is at least as expressive as the safe fragment of RC. We also propose a number of efficient query evaluation techniques for Rule-QL and test them experimentally on some representative queries to demonstrate the feasibility of Rule-QL.

Visualization of the discovered patterns is very helpful to understand how visitors navigate over the various pages on the site. Currently several web log visualization tools have been developed. However those tools are far from satisfactory. They do not provide global view of visitor access as well as individual traversal path effectively. Here we introduce Naviz, a system of interactive web log visualization that is designed to overcome those drawbacks. It combines two-dimensional graph of visitor access traversals that considers appropriate web traversal properties, i.e. hierarchization regarding traversal traffic and grouping of related pages, and facilities for filtering traversal paths by specifying visited pages and path attributes, such as number of hops, support and confidence. The tool also provides support for modern dynamic web pages. We apply the tool to visualize results of data mining study on web log data of Mobile Townpage, a directory service of phone numbers in Japan for i-Mode mobile internet users. The results indicate that our system can easily handle thousands of discovered patterns to discover interesting navigational behavior such as success paths, exit paths and lost paths.

In recent years we have witnessed an exponential increase in the amount of biological information, either DNA or protein sequences, that has become available in public databases. This has been followed by an increased interest in developing computational techniques to automatically classify these large volumes of sequence data into various categories corresponding to either their role in the chromosomes, their structure, and/or their function. In this paper we evaluate some of the widely-used sequence classification algorithms and develop a framework for modeling sequences in a fashion so that traditional machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines, can be applied easily. Our detailed experimental evaluation shows that the SVM-based approaches are able to achieve higher classification accuracy compared to the more traditional sequence classification algorithms such as Markov model based techniques and K -nearest neighbor based approaches.

Data clustering methods have been proven to be a successful data mining technique in the analysis of gene expression data. The Cluster affinity search technique (CAST) developed by Ben-Dor, et. al., 1999, which has been shown to cluster gene expression data well, has two drawbacks. First, the algorithm uses a fixed initial threshold value to start the clustering. As stated in the original paper, this parameter directly affects the size and number of clusters produced. Second, the algorithm requires a final cleaning step, which takes O(n2), to relocate n data points among the existing clusters. In this paper, we have developed and enhanced CAST algorithm, called E-CAST, that uses a dynamic threshold. The threshold value is computed at the beginning of each new cluster. We have implemented both CAST and E-CAST algorithms and tested their performance using three different data sets. The datasets are real gene expression data from melanoma, pheochromocytoma and brain cell tissue samples generated using micro-arrays technology. The results of both implementations were compared to the output from the hierarchical clustering program, written by Michael Eisen, with very comparable results. Not only did the final results compare favorably with the hierarchical approach, but they also indicate that the cleaning step of the original CAST algorithm may be unnecessary.

For topical classification, we concentrate on C and C++ programs from the Ibiblio and the Sourceforge archives. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are trained on examples of a given programming language or programs in a specified category. We show that source code can be accurately and automatically classified into topical categories and can be identified to be in a specific programming language class.

Nonlinear transformations based on common probability distributions, combined with information-driven selection, simultaneously reduce the number of dimensions required and increase the value of those we retain. Experiments on real data confirm that this approach reveals correlations, finds novel attributes, and scales well.

However, the problem of spotting complete web sites is not handled adequately yet, in spite of its importance for various applications. Therefore, this paper discusses the classification of complete web sites. First, we point out the main differences to page classification by discussing a very intuitive approach and its weaknesses. This approach treats a web site as one large HTML-document and applies the well-known methods for page classification. Next, we show how accuracy can be improved by employing a preprocessing step which assigns an occurring web page to its most likely topic. The determined topics now represent the information the web site contains and can be used to classify it more accurately. We accomplish this by following two directions. First, we apply well established classification algorithms to a feature space of occurring topics. The second direction treats a site as a tree of occurring topics and uses a Markov tree model for further classification. To improve the efficiency of this approach, we additionally introduce a powerful pruning method reducing the number of considered web pages. Our experiments show the superiority of the Markov tree approach regarding classification accuracy. In particular, we demonstrate that the use of our pruning method not only reduces the processing time, but also improves the classification accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a more sophisticated approach to simultaneously detect multiple categories of text using parametric mixture models (PMMs), newly presented in this paper. PMMs are probabilistic generative models for text that has multiple categories. Our PMMs are essentially different from the conventional mixture of multinomial distributions in the sense that in the former several basis multinomial parameters are mixed in the parameter space, while in the latter several multinomial components are mixed. We derive efficient learning algorithms for PMMs within the framework of the maximum a posteriori estimate. We also empirically show that our method can outperform the conventional binary approach when applied to multitopic detection of World Wide Web pages, focusing on those from the ""yahoo.com"" domain."

The well-known methods of text clustering, however, do not really address the special problems of text clustering: very high dimensionality of the data, very large size of the databases and understandability of the cluster description. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach which uses frequent item (term) sets for text clustering. Such frequent sets can be efficiently discovered using algorithms for association rule mining. To cluster based on frequent term sets, we measure the mutual overlap of frequent sets with respect to the sets of supporting documents. We present two algorithms for frequent term-based text clustering, FTC which creates flat clusterings and HFTC for hierarchical clustering. An experimental evaluation on classical text documents as well as on web documents demonstrates that the proposed algorithms obtain clusterings of comparable quality significantly more efficiently than state-of-the- art text clustering algorithms. Furthermore, our methods provide an understandable description of the discovered clusters by their frequent term sets.

The main challenge in this task is designing a function that can resolve when a pair of records refer to the same entity in spite of various data inconsistencies. Most existing systems use hand-coded functions. One way to overcome the tedium of hand-coding is to train a classifier to distinguish between duplicates and non-duplicates. The success of this method critically hinges on being able to provide a covering and challenging set of training pairs that bring out the subtlety of deduplication function. This is non-trivial because it requires manually searching for various data inconsistencies between any two records spread apart in large lists.We present our design of a learning-based deduplication system that uses a novel method of interactively discovering challenging training pairs using active learning. Our experiments on real-life datasets show that active learning significantly reduces the number of instances needed to achieve high accuracy. We investigate various design issues that arise in building a system to provide interactive response, fast convergence, and interpretable output.

A number of approaches have been developed that are effective at optimizing cost-sensitive decisions when each decision is considered in isolation. However, the issue of sequential decision making, with the goal of maximizing total benefits accrued over a period of time instead of immediate benefits, has rarely been addressed. In the present paper, we propose a novel approach to sequential decision making based on the reinforcement learning framework. Our approach attempts to learn decision rules that optimize a sequence of cost-sensitive decisions so as to maximize the total benefits accrued over time. We use the domain of targeted' marketing as a testbed for empirical evaluation of the proposed method. We conducted experiments using approximately two years of monthly promotion data derived from the well-known KDD Cup 1998 donation data set. The experimental results show that the proposed method for optimizing total accrued benefits out performs the usual targeted-marketing methodology of optimizing each promotion in isolation. We also analyze the behavior of the targeting rules that were obtained and discuss their appropriateness to the application domain.

The goal of the knowledge discovery and data mining is to extract the useful knowledge from the given data. Visualization enables us to find structures, features, patterns, and relationships in a dataset by presenting the data in various graphical forms with possible interactions. Recently, DNA microarray technology provides a board snapshot of the state of the cell by measuring the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. Such information can thus be used to analyze different samples by the gene expression profiles. Last few years saw many cluster analysis and classsification methods extensively be applied to capture the similarity pattern of gene expressions. A novel interactive visualization approach, VizCluster, was presented and applied to classify samples of two types. It combines the merits of both high dimensional projection scatter plot and parallel coordinate plot, taking advantage of graphical visualization methods to reveal the underlining data patterns. In this paper, we expand VizCluster to classify multiple types of samples. First, we identify genes which are differentially expressed across the sample groups. Then we apply VizCluster to build classifiers based on those genes. Finally, classifiers were evaluated by either hold out or cross validation. Five gene expression data sets were used to illustrate the approach. Experimental performance demonstrated the feasibility and usefulness of this approach.

The result of applying the method to an algorithm is that its running time becomes independent of the size of the database, while the decisions made are essentially identical to those that would be made given infinite data. The method works within pre-specified memory limits and, as long as the data is iid, only requires accessing it sequentially. It gives anytime results, and can be used to produce batch, stream, time-changing and active-learning versions of an algorithm. We apply the method to learning Bayesian networks, developing an algorithm that is faster than previous ones by orders of magnitude, while achieving essentially the same predictive performance. We observe these gains on a series of large databases ""generated from benchmark networks, on the KDD Cup 2000 e-commerce data, and on a Web log containing 100 million requests."

Our system, InfoDiscoverer, first partitions a page into several content blocks according to HTML tag <TABLE> in a Web page. Based on the occurrence of the features (terms) in the set of pages, it calculates entropy value of each feature. According to the entropy value of each feature in a content block, the entropy value of the block is defined. By analyzing the information measure, we propose a method to dynamically select the entropy-threshold that partitions blocks into either informative or redundant. Informative content blocks are distinguished parts of the page, whereas redundant content blocks are common parts. Based on the answer set generated from 13 manually tagged news Web sites with a total of 26,518 Web pages, experiments show that both recall and precision rates are greater than 0.956. That is, using the approach, informative blocks (news articles) of these sites can be automatically separated from semantically redundant contents such as advertisements, banners, navigation panels, news categories, etc. By adopting InfoDiscoverer as the preprocessor of information retrieval and extraction applications, the retrieval and extracting precision will be increased, and the indexing size and extracting complexity will also be reduced.

The experimental results show that the method performs well reaching over 80% in accuracy. Moreover, this paper illustrates, by comparison to other published research, how important the data cleaning phase is in building an accurate data mining architecture for image classification.

However, they often include many rare senses while missing corpus/domain-specific senses. We present a clustering algorithm called CBC (Clustering By Committee) that automatically discovers word senses from text. It initially discovers a set of tight clusters called committees that are well scattered in the similarity space. The centroid of the members of a committee is used as the feature vector of the cluster. We proceed by assigning words to their most similar clusters. After assigning an element to a cluster, we remove their overlapping features from the element. This allows CBC to discover the less frequent senses of a word and to avoid discovering duplicate senses. Each cluster that a word belongs to represents one of its senses. We also present an evaluation methodology for automatically measuring the precision and recall of discovered senses.

Understanding and learning the subjective aspect of humans in Content-Based Image Retrieval has been an active research field during the past few years. However, how to effectively discover users' concept patterns when there are multiple visual features existing in the retrieval system still remains a big issue. In this paper, we propose a multimedia data mining framework that incorporates Multiple Instance Learning into the user relevance feedback in a seamless way to discover the concept patterns of users, especially where the user's most interested region and how to map the local feature vector of that region to the high-level concept pattern of users. This underlying mapping can be progressively discovered through the feedback and learning procedure. The role user plays in the retrieval system is to guide the system mining process to his/her own focus of attention. The retrieval performance is tested under a couple of conditions.

With the advent of fast computer systems, scientists are now able to generate terabytes of simulation data. Unfortunately, the sheer size of these data sets has made efficient exploration of them impossible. To aid scientists in gleaning insight from their simulation data, we have developed an ad-hoc query infrastructure. Our system, called AQSim (short for Ad-hoc Queries for Simulation) reduces the data storage requirements and query access times in two stages. First, it creates and stores mathematical and statistical models of the data at multiple resolutions. Second, it evaluates queries on the models of the data instead of on the entire data set. In this paper, we present two simple but effective statistical modeling techniques for simulation data. Our first modeling technique computes the “true” (unbiased) mean of systematic partitions of the data. It makes no assumptions about the distribution of the data and uses a variant of the root mean square error to evaluate a model. Our second statistical modeling technique uses the Andersen-Darling goodness-of-fit method on systematic partitions of the data. This method evaluates a model by how well it passes the normality test on the data. Both of our statistical models effectively answer range queries. At each resolution of the data, we compute the precision of our answer to the user's query by scaling the onesided Chebyshev Inequalities with the original mesh's topology. We combine precisions at different resolutions by calculating their weighted average. Our experimental evaluations on two scientific simulation data sets illustrate the value of using these statistical modeling techniques on multiple resolutions of large simulation data sets.

The 3D conformation of a protein may be compactly represented in a symmetrical, square, boolean matrix of pairwise, inter-residue contacts, or “contact map”. The contact map provides a host of useful information about the protein's structure. In this paper we describe how data mining can be used to extract valuable information from contact maps. For example, clusters of contacts represent certain secondary structures, and also capture non-local interactions, giving clues to the tertiary structure. In this paper we focus on two main tasks: 1) Given the database of protein sequences, discover an extensive set of non-local (frequent) dense patterns in their contact maps, and compile a library of such non-local interactions. 2) Cluster these patterns based on their similarities and evaluate the clustering quality. We show via experiments that our techniques are effective in characterizing contact patterns across different proteins, and can be used to improve contact map prediction for unknown proteins as well as to learn protein folding pathways.

We base this tool on Polaris, a system for rapidly constructing table-based graphical displays of multidimensional databases. Polaris builds visualizations using an algebraic formalism derived from the interface and interpreted as a set of queries to a database. We extend the user interface, algebraic formalism, and generation of data queries in Polaris to expose and take advantage of hierarchical structure. In the resulting system, analysts can navigate through the hierarchical projections of a database, rapidly and incrementally generating visualizations for each projection.

At the same time the increasing prevalence of massive datasets and the expansion of the field of data mining has created the need to produce statistically sound methods that scale to these large problems. Except for the most trivial examples, current MCMC methods require a complete scan of the dataset for each iteration eliminating their candidacy as feasible data mining techniques.In this article we present a method for making Bayesian analysis of massive datasets computationally feasible. The algorithm simulates from a posterior distribution that conditions on a smaller, more manageable portion of the dataset. The remainder of the dataset may be incorporated by reweighting the initial draws using importance sampling. Computation of the importance weights requires a single scan of the remaining observations. While importance sampling increases efficiency in data access, it comes at the expense of estimation efficiency. A simple modification, based on the ""rejuvenation"" step used in particle filters for dynamic systems models, sidesteps the loss of efficiency with only a slight increase in the number of data accesses.To show proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the method on a mixture of transition models that has been used to model web traffic and robotics. For this example we show that estimation efficiency is not affected while offering a 95% reduction in data accesses."

Any kind of relationship, such as actors appearing in movies, can be represented as a graph. This work presents a data mining tool, called ANF, that can quickly answer a number of interesting questions on graph-represented data, such as the following. How robust is the Internet to failures? What are the most influential database papers? Are there gender differences in movie appearance patterns? At its core, ANF is based on a fast and memory-efficient approach for approximating the complete ""neighbourhood function"" for a graph. For the Internet graph (268K nodes), ANF's highly-accurate approximation is more than 700 times faster than the exact computation. This reduces the running time from nearly a day to a matter of a minute or two, allowing users to perform ad hoc drill-down tasks and to repeatedly answer questions about changing data sources. To enable this drill-down, ANF employs new techniques for approximating neighbourhood-type functions for graphs with distinguished nodes and/or edges. When compared to the best existing approximation, ANF's approach is both faster and more accurate, given the same resources. Additionally, unlike previous approaches, ANF scales gracefully to handle disk resident graphs. Finally, we present some of our results from mining large graphs using ANF."

Regression trees with linear models in the leaves satisfy both these requirements, but thus far, no truly scalable regression tree algorithm is known. This paper proposes a novel regression tree construction algorithm (SECRET) that produces trees of high quality and scales to very large datasets. At every node, SECRET uses the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixtures to find two clusters in the data and to locally transform the regression problem into a classification problem based on closeness to these clusters. Goodness of split measures, like the gini gain, can then be used to determine the split variable and the split point much like in classification tree construction. Scalability of the algorithm can be achieved by employing scalable versions of the EM and classification tree construction algorithms. An experimental evaluation on real and artificial data shows that SECRET has accuracy comparable to other linear regression tree algorithms but takes orders of magnitude less computation time for large datasets.

In Phase I a large initial sample of transactions is collected and used to quickly and accurately estimate the support of each individual item in the database. In Phase II these estimated supports are used to either trim ""outlier"" transactions or select ""representative"" transactions from the initial sample, thereby forming a small final sample that more accurately reflects the statistical characteristics (i.e., itemset supports) of the entire database. The expensive operation of discovering association rules is then performed on the final sample. In an empirical study, FAST was able to achieve 90--95% accuracy using a final sample having a size of only 15--33% of that of a comparable random sample. This efficiency gain resulted in a speedup by roughly a factor of 10 over previous algorithms that require expensive processing of the entire database --- even efficient algorithms that exploit sampling. Our new sampling technique can be used in conjunction with almost any standard association-rule algorithm, and can potentially render scalable other algorithms that mine ""count"" data."

Our algorithm is fundamentally different from those proposed in the past in that it opportunistically chooses between two different structures, array-based or tree-based, to represent projected transaction subsets, and heuristically decides to build unfiltered pseudo projection or to make a filtered copy according to features of the subsets. More importantly, we propose novel methods to build tree-based pseudo projections and array-based unfiltered projections for projected transaction subsets, which makes our algorithm both CPU time efficient and memory saving. Basically, the algorithm grows the frequent item set tree by depth first search, whereas breadth first search is used to build the upper portion of the tree if necessary. We test our algorithm versus several other algorithms on real world datasets, such as BMS-POS, and on IBM artificial datasets. The empirical results show that our algorithm is not only the most efficient on both sparse and dense databases at all levels of support threshold, but also highly scalable to very large databases.

Prior efficient solutions are less suited to real time application, often requiring all training data to be labeled, and do not inherently provide an intuitive idea of what the data model means. Our system, called ADMIT, relaxes these constraints, by creating user profiles using semi-incremental techniques. It is a real-time intrusion detection system with host-based data collection and processing. Our method also suggests ideas for dealing with concept drift and affords a detection rate as high as 80.3% and a false positive rate as low as 15.3%.

In this problem, it is desired to find web pages which satisfy a predicate specified by the user. Such a predicate could be a keyword query, a topical query, or some arbitrary contraint. Several techniques such as focussed crawling and intelligent crawling have recently been proposed for topic specific resource discovery. All these crawlers are linkage based, since they use the hyperlink behavior in order to perform resource discovery. Recent studies have shown that the topical correlations in hyperlinks are quite noisy and may not always show the consistency necessary for a reliable resource discovery process. In this paper, we will approach the problem of resource discovery from an entirely different perspective; we will mine the significant browsing patterns of world wide web users in order to model the likelihood of web pages belonging to a specified predicate. This user behavior can be mined from the freely available traces of large public domain proxies on the world wide web. We refer to this technique as collaborative crawling because it mines the collective user experiences in order to find topical resources. Such a strategy is extremely effective because the topical consistency in world wide web browsing patterns turns out to very reliable. In addition, the user-centered crawling system can be combined with linkage based systems to create an overall system which works more effectively than a system based purely on either user behavior or hyperlinks.

The need for computational efficiency is well-recognized by the data mining community, which sprung from the database community concern for efficient manipulation of large datasets. The motivation for cognitive efficiency is more elusive but at least as important. In as much as cognitive efficiency can be informally construed as ease of understanding, then what is important is any tool or technique that presents cognitively manageable abstractions of large datasets. We present our initial development of a framework for gathering, analyzing, and redeploying web data. Not dissimilar to conventional data mining, the general idea is that good use of web data first requires the careful selection of data (both usage and content data), the deployment of appropriate learning methods, and the evaluation of the results of applying the results of learning in a web application. Our framework includes tools for building, using, and visualizing web abstractions. We present an example of the deployment of our framework to navigation improvement. The abstractions we develop are called Navigation Compression Models (NCMs), and we show a method for creating them, using them, and visualizing them to aid in their understanding.

Most traditional clustering algorithms assume that the data is provided without measurement error. Often, however, real world data sets have such errors and one can obtain estimates of these errors. We present a clustering method that incorporates information contained in these error estimates. We present a new distance function that is based on the distribution of errors in data. Using a Gaussian model for errors, the distance function follows a Chi-Square distribution and is easy to compute. This distance function is used in hierarchical clustering to discover meaningful clusters. The distance function is scale-invariant so that clustering results are independent of units of measuring data. In the special case when the error distribution is the same for each attribute of data points, the rank order of pair-wise distances is the same for our distance function and the Euclidean distance function. The clustering method is applied to the seasonality estimation problem and experimental results are presented for the retail industry data as well as for simulated data, where it outperforms classical clustering methods.
5AD240C0	Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	william w cohen + jacob richman + whizbang labs	2002	Learning to match and cluster entity names	record linkage		"
Information retrieval is, in large part, the study of methods for assessing the similarity of pairs of documents. Document similarity metrics have been used for many tasks including ad hoc document retrieval, text classification [YC1994], and summarization [GC1998,SSMB1997]. Another problem area in which similarity metrics are central is record linkage (e.g., [KA1985]), where one wishes to determine if two database records taken from different source databases refer to the same entity. For instance, one might wish to determine if two database records from two different hospitals, each containing a patient's name, address, and insurance information, refer to the same person; as another example, one might wish to determine if two bibliography records, each containing a paper title, list of authors, and journal name, refer to the same publication. In both of these examples (and in many other practical cases) most of the record fields contain text---person names, paper titles and so on. It is natural to ask if document similarity metrics developed in the IR community can be useful for matching and clustering entity names. Recently there has been a substantial amount of work in addressing this question. Somewhat surprisingly, traditional IR document similarity metrics have experimentally been useful in comparing the very short “documents” that are used as informal names for entities. TF-IDF similarity metrics have been shown to be competitive with or superior to hand-coded similarity metrics and string editdistance based metrics in a variety of domains, ranging from bibliographic references for scientific papers [LGB1999] to names of animal species and popular movies [C2000]. Even when TF-IDF similarity is not the most accurate similarity metric, it is often the fastest reasonable metric, and can be usefully applied in combination with other, more computationally expensive similarity tests [MNRS2000]. In this paper, we propose and describe several techniques for adaptively modifying document similarity metrics. We will evaluate these techniques but on entity-matching and entity-clustering tasks---in particular, we evaluate using learned similarity metrics in combination with simple TFIDF based distance schemes. Our hope is that learned distance metrics can improve on generalpurpose, task-independent distance metrics like TF-IDF, and ultimately provide performance comparable to engineered, domain-specific distance metrics and/or entity matching schemes (e.g. [HS1998, GFS2000]). Although our evaluation is solely in the context of entity-name matching and clustering, we conjecture that similar learning methods will be useful in other tasks involving document similarity metrics, such as document retrieval, summarization, classification, and clustering. Below we more precisely define the problem, present an algorithm, present our experimental results. We then discuss related work and present some concluding remarks.

They often outperform generative classifiers, especially those that use inaccurate generative models, such as the naïve Bayes (NB) classifier. On the other hand, generative classifiers have no trouble in handling an arbitrary number of classes efficiently, and NB classifiers train much faster than SVMs owing to their extreme simplicity. In contrast, SVMs handle multi-class problems by learning redundant yes/no (one-vs-others) classifiers for each class, further worsening the performance gap. We propose a new technique for multi-way classification which exploits the accuracy of SVMs and the speed of NB classifiers. We first use a NB classifier to quickly compute a confusion matrix, which is used to reduce the number and complexity of the two-class SVMs that are built in the second stage. During testing, we first get the prediction of a NB classifier and use that to selectively apply only a subset of the two-class SVMs. On standard benchmarks, our algorithm is 3 to 6 times faster than SVMs and yet matches or even exceeds their accuracy.

The analysis of user behavior on the Web presupposes a reliable reconstruction of the users' navigational activities. Cookies and server-generated session identifiers have been designed to allow a faithful session reconstruction. However, in the absence of reliable methods, analysts must rely on heuristics methods (a) to identify unique visitors to a site, and (b) to distinguish among the activities of such users during independent sessions. The characteristics of the site, such as the site structure, as well as the methods used for data collection (e.g., the existence of cookies and reliable synchronization across multiple servers) may necessitate the use of different types of heuristics. In this study, we extend our work on the reliability of sessionizing mechanisms, by investigating the impact of site structure on the quality of constructed sessions. Specifically, we juxtapose sessionizing on a frame-based and a frame-free version of a site. We investigate the behavior of cookies, server-generated session identification, and heuristics that exploit session duration, page stay time and page linkage. Different measures of session reconstruction quality, as well as experiments on the impact on the prediction of frequent entry and exit pages, show that different reconstruction heuristics can be recommended depending on the characteristics of the site. We also present first results on the impact of session reconstruction heuristics on predictive applications such as Web personalization.

For example, aiming towards the design of an automated diagnostic tool for some disease, one may wish to integrate data gathered in many different hospitals. A major obstacle to such endeavors is that different data sources may vary considerably in the way they choose to represent related data. In practice, the problem is usually solved by a manual construction of semantic mappings and translations between the different sources. Recently there have been attempts to introduce automated algorithms based on machine learning tools for the construction of such translations.In this work we propose a theoretical framework for making classification predictions from a collection of different data sources, without creating explicit translations between them. Our framework allows a precise mathematical analysis of the complexity of such tasks, and it provides a tool for the development and comparison of different learning algorithms. Our main objective, at this stage, is to demonstrate the usefulness of computational learning theory to this practically important area and to stimulate further theoretical and experimental research of questions related to this framework.

Classification of spatial data streams is crucial, since the training dataset changes often. Building a new classifier each time can be very costly with most techniques. In this situation, k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification is a very good choice, since no residual classifier needs to be built ahead of time. KNN is extremely simple to implement and lends itself to a wide variety of variations. We propose a new method of KNN classification for spatial data using a new, rich, data-mining-ready structure, the Peano-count-tree (P-tree). We merely perform some AND/OR operations on P-trees to find the nearest neighbors of a new sample and assign the class label. We have fast and efficient algorithms for the AND/OR operations, which reduce the classification time significantly. Instead of taking exactly the k nearest neighbors we form a closed-KNN set. Our experimental results show closed-KNN yields higher classification accuracy as well as significantly higher speed.

One main drawback is the inability of detecting new attacks which do not have known signatures. In this paper we propose a learning algorithm that constructs models of normal behavior from attack-free network traffic. Behavior that deviates from the learned normal model signals possible novel attacks. Our IDS is unique in two respects. First, it is nonstationary, modeling probabilities based on the time since the last event rather than on average rate. This prevents alarm floods. Second, the IDS learns protocol vocabularies (at the data link through application layers) in order to detect unknown attacks that attempt to exploit implementation errors in poorly tested features of the target software. On the 1999 DARPA IDS evaluation data set [9], we detect 70 of 180 attacks (with 100 false alarms), about evenly divided between user behavioral anomalies (IP addresses and ports, as modeled by most other systems) and protocol anomalies. Because our methods are unconventional there is a significant non-overlap of our IDS with the original DARPA participants, which implies that they could be combined to increase coverage.

The same data objects can exist in inconsistent text formats across sites, making it difficult to identify matching objects using exact text match. Previous methods of object identification have required manual construction of domain-specific string transformations or manual setting of general transformation parameter weights for recognizing format inconsistencies. This manual process can be time consuming and error-prone. We have developed an object identification system called Active Atlas [18], which applies a set of domain-independent string transformations to compare the objects' shared attributes in order to identify matching objects. In this paper, we discuss extensions to the Active Atlas system, which allow it to learn to tailor the weights of a set of general transformations to a specific application domain through limited user input. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves higher accuracy and requires less user involvement than previous methods across various application domains.

Currently available bandwidth speeds can support sale of downloadable content like CDs, e-books, etc. as well as services like video-on-demand. In the future, such services will be prevalent in the Internet. Since costs are typically fixed, maximizing revenue can maximize profits. A primary determinant of revenue in such e-content markets is how much value the customers associate with the content. Though marketing surveys are useful, they cannot adapt to the dynamic nature of the Internet market. In this work, we examine how to learn customer valuations in close to real-time. Our contributions in this paper are threefold: (1) we develop a probabilistic model to describe customer behavior, (2) we develop a framework for pricing e-content based on basic economic principles, and (3) we propose a price discovering algorithm that learns customer behavior parameters and suggests prices to an e-content provider. We validate our algorithm using simulations. Our simulations indicate that our algorithm generates revenue close to the maximum expectation. Further, they also indicate that the algorithm is robust to transient customer behavior.

The key ideas are to mine system audit data for consistent and useful patterns of program and user behavior, and use the set of relevant system features presented in the patterns to compute classifiers that can recognize anomalies and known intrusions. Our past experiments showed that classification rules can be used to detect intrusions, provided that sufficient audit data is available for training and the right set of system features are selected. We use the association rules and frequent episodes computed from audit data as the basis for guiding the audit data gathering and feature selection processes. In order to compute only the relevant patterns, we consider the “order of importance” and “reference” relations among the attributes of data, and modify these two basic algorithms accordingly to use axis attribute(s) and reference attribute(s) as forms of item constraints in the data mining process. We also use an iterative level-wise approximate mining procedure for uncovering the low frequency but important patterns. We report our experiments in using these algorithms on real-world audit data.

Intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. While previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. This makes them difficult and expensive to apply. The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. Such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. Taking a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. From a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework. Furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. The theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. It shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming Google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples.

The number of distinct groups in the data is then taken to be the number of mixture components, and the observations are partitioned into clusters (estimates of the groups) using Bayes' rule. If the groups are well separated and look Gaussian, then the resulting clusters will indeed tend to be ""distinct"" in the most common sense of the word - contiguous, densely populated areas of feature space, separated by contiguous, relatively empty regions. If the groups are not Gaussian, however, this correspondence may break down; an isolated group with a non-elliptical distribution, for example, may be modeled by not one, but several mixture components, and the corresponding clusters will no longer be well separated. We present methods for assessing the degree of separation between the components of a mixture model and between the corresponding clusters. We also propose a new clustering method that can be regarded as a hybrid between model-based and nonparametric clustering. The hybrid clustering algorithm prunes the cluster tree generated by hierarchical model-based clustering. Starting with the tree corresponding to the mixture model chosen by the Bayesian Information Criterion, it progressively merges clusters that do not appear to correspond to different modes of the data density."

Recently, data quality concepts have been applied to databases that support business operations such as provisioning and billing. Incorporating business rules that drive operations and their associated data processes is critically important to the success of such projects. However, there are many practical complications. For example, documentation on business rules is often meager. Rules change frequently. Domain knowledge is often fragmented across experts, and those experts do not always agree. Typically, rules have to be gathered from subject matter experts iteratively, and are discovered out of logical or procedural sequence, like a jigsaw puzzle. Our approach is to impement business rules as constraints on data in a classical expert system formalism sometimes called production rules. Our system works by allowing good data to pass through a system of constraints unchecked. Bad data violate constraints and are flagged, and then fed back after correction. Constraints are added incrementally as better understanding of the business rules is gained. We include a real-life case study.

We propose to use decision trees not just for classification but also for the wider purpose of knowledge discovery, because visualizing the decision tree can reveal much valuable information in the data. We introduce PaintingClass, a system for interactive construction, visualization and exploration of decision trees. PaintingClass provides an intuitive layout and convenient navigation of the decision tree. PaintingClass also provides the user the means to interactively construct the decision tree. Each node in the decision tree is displayed as a visual projection of the data. Through actual examples and comparison with other classification methods, we show that the user can effectively use PaintingClass to construct a decision tree and explore the decision tree to gain additional knowledge.

Using the hypothetical ensemble algorithm in Hilbert space, we explain that A-Boosting can be understood as a method of constructing a sequence of hypotheses and coefficients such that the average of the product of the base hypotheses and coefficients converges to the desirable function. Empirical studies showed that A-Boosting outperforms Bagging for low noise cases and is more robust than AdaBoost to label noise.

A spatial time series dataset is a collection of time series, each referencing a location in a common spatial framework. Correlation analysis is often used to identify pairs of potentially interacting elements from the cross product of two spatial time series datasets. However, the computational cost of correlation analysis is very high when the dimension of the time series and the number of locations in the spatial frameworks are large. The key contribution of this paper is the use of spatial autocorrelation among spatial neighboring time series to reduce computational cost. A filter-and-refine algorithm based on coning, i.e. grouping of locations, is proposed to reduce the cost of correlation analysis over a pair of spatial time series datasets. Cone-level correlation computation can be used to eliminate (filter out) a large number of element pairs whose correlation is clearly below (or above) a given threshold. Element pair correlation needs to be computed for remaining pairs. Using experimental studies with Earth science datasets, we show that the filter-and-refine approach can save a large fraction of the computational cost, particularly when the minimal correlation threshold is high.

This paper proposes a method to learn first-order Bayesian network (FOBN) which can handle imperfect data powerfully. Due to a high computation cost for directly learning FOBN, we adapt an ILP and a Bayesian network learner to construct FOBN. We propose a feature extraction algorithm to generate features from ILP rules, and use these features as the main structure of the FOBN. We also propose a propositionalisation algorithm for translating the original data into the single table format to learn the remaining parts of the FOBN structure and its conditional probability tables by a standard Bayesian network learner.

Though designed for very large volumes of geospatial data, the algorithm is general enough to be used in a wide variety of domain applications. The number of computations the algorithm requires is ~ O(N), and thus faster than hierarchical algorithms. Unlike the popular K-means heuristic, this algorithm does not require a series of iterations to converge to a solution. In addition, this method does not depend on initialization of a given number of cluster representatives, and so is insensitive to initial conditions. Being unsupervised, the algorithm can also ""rank"" each cluster based on density. The method relies on weighting a dataset to grid points on a mesh, and using a small number of rule-based agents to find the high density clusters. This method effectively reduces large datasets to the size of the grid, which is usually many orders of magnitude smaller. Numerical experiments are shown that demonstrate the advantages of this algorithm over other techniques."

KDD techniques, such as association finding, are well-matched to the problem, but are difficult for medical staff to apply and interpret.To deploy KDD effectively for pharmacovigilance, Lincoln Technologies and GlaxoSmithKline collaborated to create a webbased safety data mining web environment. The analytical core is a high-performance implementation of the MGPS (Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker) algorithm described previously by DuMouchel and Pregibon, with several significant extensions and enhancements. The environment offers an interface for specifying data mining runs, a batch execution facility, tabular and graphical methods for exploring associations, and drilldown to case details. Substantial work was involved in preparing the raw adverse event data for mining, including harmonization of drug names and removal of duplicate reports.The environment can be used to explore both drug-event and multi-way associations (interactions, syndromes).

Traditionally, tree models (such as DOM trees) have been used to represent structural information, especially in the case of HTML and XML documents. However, computation of structural similarity between documents based on the tree model is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose an alternative scheme for representing the structural information of documents based on the paths contained in the corresponding tree model. Since the model includes partial information about parents, children and siblings, it allows us to define a new family of meaningful (and at the same time computationally simple) structural similarity measures. Our experimental results based on the SIGMOD XML data set as well as HTML document collections from ibm.com, dell.com, and amazon.com show that the representation is powerful enough to produce good clusters of structurally similar pages.

We undertook a study with a retail collaborator to compare contrast-set mining with existing rule-discovery techniques. To our surprise we observed that straightforward application of an existing commercial rule-discovery system, Magnum Opus, could successfully perform the contrast-set-mining task. This led to the realization that contrast-set mining is a special case of the more general rule-discovery task. We present the results of our study together with a proof of this conclusion.

We have identified a new paradigm of problems --- that of automatic community generation based on uni-party data, the data in which there is no direct or explicit link information available. Consequently, we have proposed a new methodology for Link Discovery based on Correlation Analysis (LDCA). We have used MLC group model generation as an exemplary application of this problem paradigm, and have focused on this application to develop a specific method of automatic MLC group model generation based on timeline analysis using the LDCA methodology, called CORAL. A prototype of CORAL method has been implemented, and preliminary testing and evaluations based on a real MLC case data are reported. The contributions of this work are: (1) identification of the uni-party data community generation problem paradigm, (2) proposal of a new methodology LDCA to solve for problems in this paradigm, (3) formulation of the MLC group model generation problem as an example of this paradigm, (4) application of the LDCA methodology in developing a specific solution (CORAL) to the MLC group model generation problem, and (5) development, evaluation, and testing of the CORAL prototype in a real MLC case data.

We present our algorithm in the context of a gene-expression dataset. Gene expression data, in most situations, is insufficient for clustering algorithms and any statistical inference because for 6000+ genes, typically only 10s and at most 100s of data points become available. It is difficult to use statistical techniques to design a classifier for such immensely under-specified data. The observed data, though statistically, insufficient contains some information about the domain. Our goal is to discover as much information about all potential classifiers as possible from the data and then summarize this knowledge. This summarization provides insights into the composition of potential classifiers. We present here algorithms and methods for mining a high dimensional data set, exemplified by a gene expression data set, for mining such information.

This view challenges fundamental assumptions commonly made in the context of several data mining algorithms.In this paper, we study the problem of identifying correlations between multiple data streams. In particular, we propose algorithms capable of capturing correlations between multiple continuous data streams in a highly efficient and accurate manner. Our algorithms and techniques are applicable in the case of both synchronous and asynchronous data streaming environments. We capture correlations between multiple streams using the well known technique of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Correlations between data items, and the SVD technique in particular, have been repeatedly utilized in an off-line (non stream) data mining problems, for example forecasting, approximate query answering, and data reduction.We propose a methodology based on a combination of dimensionality reduction and sampling to make the SVD technique suitable for a data stream context. Our techniques are approximate, trading accuracy with performance, and we analytically quantify this tradeoff. We present a through experimental evaluation, using both real and synthetic data sets, from a prototype implementation of our technique, investigating the impact of various parameters in the accuracy of the overall computation. Our results indicate, that correlations between multiple data streams can be identified very efficiently and accurately. The algorithms proposed herein, are presented as generic tools, with a multitude of applications on data stream mining problems.

Proteins resident in this membrane (outer membrane proteins, or OMPs) are of primary research interest for antibiotic and vaccine drug design as they are on the surface of the bacteria and so are the most accessible targets to develop new drugs against. With the development of genome sequencing technology and bioinformatics, biologists can now deduce all the proteins that are likely produced in a given bacteria and have attempted to classify where proteins are located in a bacterial cell. However such protein localization programs are currently least accurate when predicting OMPs, and so there is a current need for the development of a better OMP classifier. Data mining research suggests that the use of frequent patterns has good performance in aiding the development of accurate and efficient classification algorithms. In this paper, we present two methods to identify OMPs based on frequent subsequences and test them on all Gram-negative bacterial proteins whose localizations have been determined by biological experiments. One classifier follows an association rule approach, while the other is based on support vector machines (SVMs). We compare the proposed methods with the state-of-the-art methods in the biological domain. The results demonstrate that our methods are better both in terms of accurately identifying OMPs and providing biological insights that increase our understanding of the structures and functions of these important proteins."

Recent work has extended this basic paradigm to probability estimation trees. Traditional tree learning algorithms assume that instances in the training data are homogenous and independently distributed. Relational probability trees (RPTs) extend standard probability estimation trees to a relational setting in which data instances are heterogeneous and interdependent. Our algorithm for learning the structure and parameters of an RPT searches over a space of relational features that use aggregation functions (e.g. AVERAGE, MODE, COUNT) to dynamically propositionalize relational data and create binary splits within the RPT. Previous work has identified a number of statistical biases due to characteristics of relational data such as autocorrelation and degree disparity. The RPT algorithm uses a novel form of randomization test to adjust for these biases. On a variety of relational learning tasks, RPTs built using randomization tests are significantly smaller than other models and achieve equivalent, or better, performance.

In this paper, we propose a general framework for mining concept-drifting data streams using weighted ensemble classifiers. We train an ensemble of classification models, such as C4.5, RIPPER, naive Beyesian, etc., from sequential chunks of the data stream. The classifiers in the ensemble are judiciously weighted based on their expected classification accuracy on the test data under the time-evolving environment. Thus, the ensemble approach improves both the efficiency in learning the model and the accuracy in performing classification. Our empirical study shows that the proposed methods have substantial advantage over single-classifier approaches in prediction accuracy, and the ensemble framework is effective for a variety of classification models.

A rich data base is developed by running the simulations thousands of times, varying the agent and scenario input parameters as well as the random seeds. Exploring this result space may provide significant insight into nonlinear, surprising, and emergent behaviors. Capturing these results can provide a path for making the results usable for decision support to a military commander. This paper presents two data mining approaches, rule discovery and Bayesian networks, for analyzing the Albert simulation data. The first approach generates rules from the data and then uses them to create descriptive model. The second generates Bayesian Networks which provide a quantitative belief model for decision support. Both of these approaches as well as the Project Albert simulations are framed in the context of a system architecture for decision support.

As such, pattern discovery is one of the few areas of data mining that cannot be considered simply as a 'scaling-up' of current statistical methodology to analyze large data sets. However, the philosophies of hypothesis testing and modeling in traditional statistics do lend themselves to forming a framework for pattern discovery, and we can also draw from ideas relating to outlier discovery and residual analysis to discover patterns. We illustrate an iterative strategy in a statistical framework by way of its application to one simulated and two real data sets.

Inference rules are extremely important in many fields such as natural language processing, information retrieval, and artificial intelligence in general. Our algorithm is based on an extended version of Harris' Distributional Hypothesis, which states that words that occurred in the same contexts tend to be similar. Instead of using this hypothesis on words, we apply it to paths in the dependency trees of a parsed corpus.

The most effective form of the distance function can only be expressed in the context of a particular data domain. It is also often a challenging and non-trivial task to find the most effective form of the distance function. For example, in the text domain, distance function design has been considered such an important and complex issue that it has been the focus of intensive research over three decades. The final design of distance functions in this domain has been reached only by detailed empirical testing and consensus over the quality of results provided by the different variations. With the increasing ability to collect data in an automated way, the number of new kinds of data continues to increase rapidly. This makes it increasingly difficult to undertake such efforts for each and every new data type. The most important aspect of distance function design is that since a human is the end-user for any application, the design must satisfy the user requirements with regard to effectiveness. This creates the need for a systematic framework to design distance functions which are sensitive to the particular characteristics of the data domain. In this paper, we discuss such a framework. The goal is to create distance functions in an automated waywhile minimizing the work required from the user. We will show that this framework creates distance functions which are significantly more effective than popularly used functions such as the Euclidean metric.

In particular, the algorithm was designed to produce embeddings that strictly adhere to a given hierarchical clustering of the data, so that every two disjoint clusters in the hierarchy are drawn separately.

The core of autonomic computing, a recently proposed initiative towards next-generation IT-systems capable of 'self-healing', is the ability to analyze data in real-time and to predict potential problems. The goal is to avoid catastrophic failures through prompt execution of remedial actions.This paper describes an attempt to build a proactive prediction and control system for large clusters. We collected event logs containing various system reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) events, and system activity reports (SARs) from a 350-node cluster system for a period of one year. The 'raw' system health measurements contain a great deal of redundant event data, which is either repetitive in nature or misaligned with respect to time. We applied a filtering technique and modeled the data into a set of primary and derived variables. These variables used probabilistic networks for establishing event correlations through prediction algorithms. We also evaluated the role of time-series methods, rule-based classification algorithms and Bayesian network models in event prediction.Based on historical data, our results suggest that it is feasible to predict system performance parameters (SARs) with a high degree of accuracy using time-series models. Rule-based classification techniques can be used to extract machine-event signatures to predict critical events with up to 70% accuracy.

The Website structure should be designed effectively so that users can efficiently find their information. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a graph-based optimization algorithm to modify Website topology using interesting association rules. The interestingness of an association rule A ⇒ B is defined based on the probability measure between two sets of Web pages A and B in the Website. If the probability measure between A and B is low (high), then the association rule A ⇒ B has high (low) interest. The hyperlinks in the Website can be modified to adapt user access patterns according to association rules with high interest. We present experimental results and demonstrate that our method is effective.

To improve the accuracy in terms of precision and recall of an audio information retrieval system we have created a domainspecific ontology (a collection of key concepts and their interrelationships), as well as a novel, pruning algorithm. Taking into account the shortcomings of keyword-based techniques, we have opted to employ a concept-based technique utilizing this ontology. The key problem in the retrieval of audio information is to achieve high precision and high recall. Typically, in traditional approaches, high recall is achieved at the expense of low precision, and vice versa. Through the use of a domain-specific ontology appropriate concepts can be identified during metadata generation (description of audio) or query generation, thus improving precision. In case of the association of irrelevant concepts to queries or documents there is a loss of precision. On the other hand, if relevant concepts are discarded, a loss of recall will ensue. Therefore, in conjunction with the use of a domain specific ontology we have proposed a novel, automatic pruning algorithm which prunes as many irrelevant concepts as possible during any case of query generation. By associating concepts in the ontology through techniques of correlation, this algorithm presents a method for the selection of concepts in the query generation. To improve recall, controlled and correct query expansion mechanism is proposed. This guarantees that precision will not be lost. Moreover, we present a way for the query generation in which domain-specific ontology can be used to generate information selection requests in terms of database queries in SQL. In trial implementations we have demonstrated that our ontology-based model outperforms keyword-based technique (vector space model) in terms of precision and recall. 1 This research has been funded [or funded in part] by the Integrated Media Systems Center, a National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center, Cooperative Agreement No. EEC-9529152.

We have witnessed the shift of the paradigm of event management in practice from root cause analysis (RCA) to action-oriented analysis (AOA). IBM has developed a pioneer event management methodology (EMD) based on the AOA paradigm and applied it to more than two hundred production sites with success. Foreseeably, more and more event management professionals will apply AOA in different incarnations in building proactive management facilities. By that, building correct and effective Event Relationship Networks (ERNs) becomes the dominating activity in AOA service design process. Currently, the quality of ERNs and the cost of building them largely depend on the knowledge of domain experts. We believe that we can utilize historical event logs in shortening the ERNs design process and perfecting the quality of ERNs. In this paper, we describe in detail how to apply this data-driven approach in ERN validation, completion and construction.

We introduce a novel data mining technique for the analysis of gene expression. Gene expression is the effective production of the protein that a gene encodes. We focus on the characterization of the expression patterns of genes based on their promoter regions. The promoter region of a gene contains short sequences called motifs to which gene regulatory proteins may bind, thereby controlling when and in which cell types the gene is expressed. Our approach addresses two important aspects of gene expression analysis: (1) Binding of proteins at more than one motif is usually required, and several different types of proteins may need to bind several different types of motifs in order to confer transcriptional specificity. (2) Since proteins controlling transcription may need to interact physically, we know that the order and spacing in which motifs occur can affect expression. We use association rules to address the combinatorial aspect. The association rules we employ have the ability to involve multiple motifs and to predict expression in multiple cell types. To address the second aspect, we enhance association rules with information about the distances among the motifs, or items, that are present in the rule. Rules of interest are those whose set of motifs deviates properly, i.e. set of motifs whose pair-wise distances are highly conserved in the promoter regions where these motifs occur. We describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of our Distance-based Association Rule Mining algorithm (DARM) to mine those rules. We show that these distance-based rules achieve higher classification performance than standard association rules over two real datasets. gene expression analysis, distance-based association rule mining.

The main advantage of the vertical format is support for fast frequency counting via intersection operations on transaction ids (tids) and automatic pruning of irrelevant data. The main problem with these approaches is when intermediate results of vertical tid lists become too large for memory, thus affecting the algorithm scalability.In this paper we present a novel vertical data representation called Diffset, that only keeps track of differences in the tids of a candidate pattern from its generating frequent patterns. We show that diffsets drastically cut down the size of memory required to store intermediate results. We show how diffsets, when incorporated into previous vertical mining methods, increase the performance significantly.

Keywords Image mining+spatial relationship+image database	The increasing number of image repositories has made image mining an important task because of its potential in discovering useful image patterns from a large set of images. In this paper, we introduce the notion of viewpoint patterns for image databases. Viewpoint patterns refer to patterns that capture the invariant relationships of one object from the point of view of another object. These patterns are unique and significant in images because the absolute positional information of objects for most images is not important, but rather, it is the relative distance and orientation of the objects from each other that is meaningful. We design a scalable and efficient algorithm to discover such viewpoint patterns. Experiments results on various image sets demonstrate that viewpoint patterns are meaningful and interesting to human users.

It has been claimed that association rule mining is not suited for text mining. To overcome this problem, we propose (1) to generate sequential data set of words with dependency structure from the Japanese text database, and (2) to employ a new method for extracting meaningful association rules by applying a new rule selection criterion. Each inquiry in the sequential data was represented as a list of word pairs, each of which consists of a verb and its dependent noun. The association rules were induced regarding each pair of words as an item. The rule selection criterion comes from our principle that we put heavier weights to co-occurrence of multiple items more than single item occurrence. We regarded a rule important if the existence of the items in the rule body significantly affects the occurrence of the item in the rule head. The selected rules were then categorized to form meaningful information classes. With this method, we succeeded in extracting useful information classes from the text database, which were not acquired by only simple keyword retrieval. Also, inquiries with multiple aspects were properly classified into corresponding multiple categories.

Web user profiling consists of the best representative behaviors, represented by Markov models (MM). To achieve this objective, our approach is articulated around three notions: (1) Applying probabilistic exploration using Markov models. (2) Avoiding the problem of Markov model high-dimensionality and sparsity by clustering web documents, based on their content, before applying the Markov analysis. (3) Clustering Markov models, and extraction of their gravity centers. On the basis of these three notions, the approach makes possible the prediction of future states to be visited in k steps and navigation sessions monitoring, based on both content and traversed paths. The original application of the approach concerns the exploitation of multimedia archives in the perspective of the Copyright Deposit that preserves French’s WWW documents. The approach may be the exploitation tool for any web site.

We term our approach ‘semi-supervised’ because it requires significantly less effort to develop a training set than other approaches. From the training data our algorithm automatically generates regular expressions that can be used on previously unseen data for information extraction. Our experiments show that the algorithm has good testing performance on many features that are important in the fight against terrorism.

Evaluation of test outputs is also associated with a considerable effort by human testers who often have imperfect knowledge of the requirements specification. Not surprisingly, this manual approach to software testing results in heavy losses to the world's economy. The costs of the so-called ""catastrophic"" software failures (such as Mars Polar Lander shutdown in 1999) are even hard to measure. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential use of data mining algorithms for automated induction of functional requirements from execution data. The induced data mining models of tested software can be utilized for recovering missing and incomplete specifications, designing a minimal set of regression tests, and evaluating the correctness of software outputs when testing new, potentially flawed releases of the system. To study the feasibility of the proposed approach, we have applied a novel data mining algorithm called Info-Fuzzy Network (IFN) to execution data of a general-purpose code for solving partial differential equations. After being trained on a relatively small number of randomly generated input-output examples, the model constructed by the IFN algorithm has shown a clear capability to discriminate between correct and faulty versions of the program."

Such datasets, which frequently arise in a wide variety of applications, pose some of the most significant challenges in data analysis. Subsampling and compression are two key technologies for analyzing these datasets. PROXIMUS provides a technique for reducing large datasets into a much smaller set of representative patterns, on which traditional (expensive) analysis algorithms can be applied with minimal loss of accuracy. We show desirable properties of PROXIMUS in terms of runtime, scalability to large datasets, and performance in terms of capability to represent data in a compact form. We also demonstrate applications of PROXIMUS in association rule mining. In doing so, we establish PROXIMUS as a tool for preprocessing data before applying computationally expensive algorithms or as a tool for directly extracting correlated patterns. Our experimental results show that use of the compressed data for association rule mining provides excellent precision and recall values (near 100%) across a range of support thresholds while reducing the time required for association rule mining drastically.

One major problem is the high memory dependency: either the gigantic data structure built is assumed to fit in main memory, or the recursive mining process is too voracious in memory resources. Another major impediment is the repetitive and interactive nature of any knowledge discovery process. To tune parameters, many runs of the same algorithms are necessary leading to the building of these huge data structures time and again. This paper proposes a new disk-based association rule mining algorithm called Inverted Matrix, which achieves its efficiency by applying three new ideas. First, transactional data is converted into a new database layout called Inverted Matrix that prevents multiple scanning of the database during the mining phase, in which finding frequent patterns could be achieved in less than a full scan with random access. Second, for each frequent item, a relatively small independent tree is built summarizing co-occurrences. Finally, a simple and non-recursive mining process reduces the memory requirements as minimum candidacy generation and counting is needed. Experimental studies reveal that our Inverted Matrix approach outperform FP-Tree especially in mining very large transactional databases with a very large number of unique items. Our random access disk-based approach is particularly advantageous in a repetitive and interactive setting. Copyright 2003 ACM.

The idea is to create a smaller data set that allows statistical modeling to take place using in-memory algorithms, and to preserve the modeling results more accurately than would a same-size random sample from the massive data set. This research attempts to avoid several limitations of previous approaches to data squashing. Our method avoids the curse of dimensionality by a double use of principal components transformations that makes computing time linear in the number of cases and quadratic in the number of variables. Categorical and continuous variables are smoothly integrated. Because the binning is based on principal components, which are uncorrelated, we can use fractional factorial designs that sample less than one point per bin. We also investigate various weighting schemes for the squashed sample to see whether matching moments or matching subregion data counts is more effective. Finally, previous work required the specification of a statistical model, either to perform the squashing algorithm or to compare the worth of different squashing methods. Our approach to evaluation is model free and does not even require the specification of variables as responses or predictors. Instead, we develop a chi-squared like measure of accuracy to compare the closeness of various discrete densities (the squashed data sets) to the discrete massive data set."

Under the model, intra-cluster association and external differentiation are both assessed in terms of a natural confidence measure. Minor clusters can be identified even when they appear in the intersection of larger clusters. Scalability of local clustering derives from recent generic techniques for efficient approximate similarity search. The cluster overlap structure gives rise to a hierarchy that can be navigated and queried by users. Experimental results are provided for two large text databases.

This work is motivated by the difficulties experienced in the medical domain to identify and track dyspepsia symptom clusters within and across time. Our framework, Apriori with Subgroup and Constraint (ASC), is built on top of the existing Apriori framework. We have identified four different types of phase-wise constraints for subgroups: constraint across subgroups, constraint on subgroup, constraint on pattern content and constraint on rule. ASC has been evaluated in a real-world medical scenario; analysis was conducted with the interaction of a domain expert. Although the framework is evaluated using a data set from the medical domain, it should be general enough to be applicable in other domains.

Several visualization techniques have been developed to study the cluster structure of data, i.e., the existence of distinctive groups in the data and how these clusters are related to each other. However, only few of these techniques lend themselves to studying how this structure changes if the features describing the data are changed. Understanding this relationship between the features and the cluster structure means understanding the features themselves and is thus a useful tool in the feature extraction phase.In this paper we present a novel approach to visualizing how modification of the features with respect to weighting or normalization changes the cluster structure. We demonstrate the application of our approach in two music related data mining projects.

Accurate forecasts of the expected number of no-shows for each flight can increase airline revenue by reducing the number of spoiled seats (empty seats that might otherwise have been sold) and the number of involuntary denied boardings at the departure gate. Conventional no-show forecasting methods typically average the no-show rates of historically similar flights, without the use of passenger-specific information.We develop two classes of models to predict cabin-level no-show rates using specific information on the individual passengers booked on each flight. The first of these models computes the no-show probability for each passenger, using both the cabin-level historical forecast and the extracted passenger features as explanatory variables. This passenger-level model is implemented using three different predictive methods: a C4.5 decision-tree, a segmented Naive Bayes algorithm, and a new aggregation method for an ensemble of probabilistic models. The second cabin-level model is formulated using the desired cabin-level no-show rate as the response variable. Inputs to this model include the predicted cabin-level no-show rates derived from the various passenger-level models, as well as simple statistics of the features of the cabin passenger population. The cabin-level model is implemented using either linear regression, or as a direct probability model with explicit incorporation of the cabin-level no-show rates derived from the passenger-level model outputs.The new passenger-based models are compared to a conventional historical model, using train and evaluation data sets taken from over 1 million passenger name records. Standard metrics such as lift curves and mean-square cabin-level errors establish the improved accuracy of the passenger-based models over the historical model. All models are also evaluated using a simple revenue model, and it is shown that the cabin-level passenger-based model can produce between 0.4% and 3.2% revenue gain over the conventional model, depending on the revenue-model parameters.

Effective stylistic characterization of text is potentially useful for a variety of tasks, as language style contains cues regarding the authorship, purpose, and mood of the text, all of which would be useful adjuncts to information retrieval or knowledge-management tasks. We focus here on the problem of determining the author of an anonymous message, based only on the message text. Several multiclass variants of the Winnow algorithm were applied to a vector representation of the message texts to learn models for discriminating different authors. We present results comparing the classification accuracy of the different approaches. The results show that stylistic models can be accurately learned to determine an author's identity.

Markov models and their variations, or models based on sequence mining have been found well suited for this problem. However, higher order Markov models are extremely complicated due to their large number of states whereas lower order Markov models do not capture the entire behavior of a user in a session. The models that are based on sequential pattern mining only consider the frequent sequences in the data set, making it difficult to predict the next request following a page that is not in the sequential pattern. Furthermore, it is hard to find models for mining two different kinds of information of a user session. We propose a new model that considers both the order information of pages in a session and the time spent on them. We cluster user sessions based on their pair-wise similarity and represent the resulting clusters by a click-stream tree. The new user session is then assigned to a cluster based on a similarity measure. The click-stream tree of that cluster is used to generate the recommendation set. The model can be used as part of a cache prefetching system as well as a recommendation model.

In this paper, we propose an interactive exploration framework for mining coherent expression patterns in time-series gene expression data. We develop a novel tool, coherent pattern index graph, to give users highly confident indications of the existences of coherent patterns. To derive a coherent pattern index graph, we devise an attraction tree structure to record the genes in the data set and summarize the information needed for the interactive exploration. We present fast and scalable algorithms to construct attraction trees and coherent pattern index graphs from gene expression data sets.

The experimental results strongly show that our approach is more effective than the state-of-the-art methods in mining real gene expression data, and is scalable in mining large data sets.

Empirical studies and initial statistics collected from the MORF filters deployed at sites in the U.S. and Asia show that MORF is both efficient and effective, due to our classification methods.

However, frequent pattern mining remains a time-consuming process, especially for very large datasets. It is therefore desirable to adopt a ""mining once and using many times"" strategy. Unfortunately, there has been little work reported on managing and organizing a large set of patterns for future use. In this paper, we propose a disk-based data structure, CFP-tree (Condensed Frequent Pattern Tree), for organizing frequent patterns discovered from transactional databases. In addition to an efficient algorithm for CFP-tree construction, we also developed algorithms to efficiently support two important types of queries, namely queries with minimum support constraints and queries with item constraints, against the stored patterns, as these two types of queries are basic building blocks for complex frequent pattern related mining tasks. Comprehensive experimental study has been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of CFP-tree and efficiency of related algorithms."

COUNT, SUM, and covering graph of the quotient cube as a visualization tool of minimal multidimensional associations. With this intention, we introduce two novel concepts: the cube transversals and the cube closures over the cube lattice of a categorical database relation. We propose a levelwise merging algorithm for mining minimal cube transversals with a single database scan. We introduce the cube connection, show that it is a Galois connection and derive a closure operator over the cube lattice. Using cube transversals and closures, we define a new characterization of boundary sets which provide a condensed representation of version spaces used to enhance supervised classification. The algorithm designed for computing such borders improves the complexity of previous proposals. We also introduce the concept of closed cube lattice and show that it is isomorph to on one hand the Galois lattice and on the other hand the quotient cube w.r.t. COUNT, SUM. Proposed in [16], the quotient cube is a succinct summary of a datacube preserving the Rollup/Drilldown semantics. We show that the quotient cube w.r.t.

Finally we focus on the multidimensional association issue and introduce the covering graph of the quotient cube which provides the user with a visualization tool of minimal multidimensional associations.

Hierarchical clustering algorithms are typically more effective in detecting the true clustering structure of a data set than partitioning algorithms. However, hierarchical clustering algorithms do not actually create clusters, but compute only a hierarchical representation of the data set. This makes them unsuitable as an automatic pre-processing step for other algorithms that operate on detected clusters. This is true for both dendrograms and reachability plots, which have been proposed as hierarchical clustering representations, and which have different advantages and disadvantages. In this paper we first investigate the relation between dendrograms and reachability plots and introduce methods to convert them into each other showing that they essentially contain the same information. Based on reachability plots, we then introduce a technique that automatically determines the significant clusters in a hierarchical cluster representation. This makes it for the first time possible to use hierarchical clustering as an automatic pre-processing step that requires no user interaction to select clusters from a hierarchical cluster representation.

Here each of the distributions is specified by common parameters and individual parameters e.g., a normal distribution with an identical mean and a different variance. Here we introduce a notion of an information consortium, which is a framework where the agents cannot show raw data to one another, but they like to enjoy significant information gain for estimating the respective distributions. Such an information consortium has recently received much interest in a broad range of areas including financial risk management, ubiquitous network mining, etc. In this paper we are concerned with the following three issues: 1) how to design a collaborative strategy for agents to estimate the respective distributions in the information consortium, 2) characterizing when each agent has a benefit in terms of information gain for estimating its distribution or information loss for predicting future data, and 3) charracterizing how much benefit each agent obtains. In this paper we yield a statistical formulation of information consortia and solve all of the above three problems for a general form of probability distributions. Specifically we propose a basic strategy for cooperative estimation and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for each agent to have a significant benefit.

Images are highly complex multidimensional signals, with rich and complicated information content. For this reason they are difficult to analyze through a unique automated approach. However, a hierarchical representation is helpful for the understanding of image content. In this paper, we describe an application of a scale-space clustering algorithm (melting) for exploration of image information content. Clustering by melting considers the feature space as a thermodynamical ensemble and groups the data by minimizing the free energy, having the temperature as a scale parameter. We develop clustering by melting for multidimensional data, and propose and demonstrate a solution for the initialization of the algorithm. Due to the curse of dimensionality, for initialization of clusters we choose the initial clusters centers with an algorithm that performs a fast cluster centers estimation with low computation cost. We further analyze the information extracted by melting and propose a structure for information representation that enables exploration of image content. This structure is a tree in the scale space showing how the clusters merge. Implementation of the algorithm is through a multi-tree structure. With this structure, we can explore the image content as an information mining function, we obtain a more compact data structure, we have maximum of information in scale space because we memorize the bifurcation points and the trajectories of the centers points in the scale space. The information encoded in the tree structure enables the fast reconstruction and exploration of the data cluster structure and the investigation of hierarchical sequences of image classifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with examples using satellite multispectral image (SPOT 4) and Synthetic Aperture Radar - SAR and Digital Elevation Models - DEM derived from SAR interferometry (SRTM).

Evaluation of test outputs is also associated with a considerable effort by human testers who often have imperfect knowledge of the requirements specification. Not surprisingly, this manual approach to software testing results in heavy losses to the worlds economy. The costs of the so-called """"catastrophic"""" software failures (such as Mars Polar Lander shutdown in 1999) are even hard to measure. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential use of data mining algorithms for automated induction of functional requirements from execution data. The induced data mining models of tested software can be utilized for recovering missing and incomplete specifications, designing a minimal set of regression tests, and evaluating the correctness of software outputs when testing new, potentially flawed releases of the system. To study the feasibility of the proposed approach, we have applied a novel data mining algorithm called Info-Fuzzy Network (IFN) to execution data of a general-purpose code for solving partial differential equations. After being trained on a relatively small number of randomly generated input-output examples, the model constructed by the IFN algorithm has shown a clear capability to discriminate between correct and faulty versions of the program.

However, all known algorithms learning a complete BN do not scale up beyond a few hundred variables. On the other hand, all known sound algorithms learning a local region of the network require an exponential number of training instances to the size of the learned region.The contribution of this paper is two-fold. We introduce a novel local algorithm that returns all variables with direct edges to and from a target variable T as well as a local algorithm that returns the Markov Blanket of T. Both algorithms (i) are sound, (ii) can be run efficiently in datasets with thousands of variables, and (iii) significantly outperform in terms of approximating the true neighborhood previous state-of-the-art algorithms using only a fraction of the training size required by the existing methods. A fundamental difference between our approach and existing ones is that the required sample depends on the generating graph connectivity and not the size of the local region; this yields up to exponential savings in sample relative to previously known algorithms. The results presented here are promising not only for discovery of local causal structure, and variable selection for classification, but also for the induction of complete BNs.

In this paper, we study three important issues that have been previously ignored in mining unexpected rules. First, the unexpectedness of a rule depends on how the user prefers to apply the prior knowledge to a given scenario, in addition to the knowledge itself. Second, the prior knowledge should be considered right from the start to focus the search on unexpected rules. Third, the unexpectedness of a rule depends on what other rules the user has seen so far. Thus, only rules that remain unexpected given what the user has seen should be considered interesting. We develop an approach that addresses all three problems above and evaluate it by means of experiments focusing on finding interesting rules.

The discovery of association relationship among the data in a huge database has been known to be useful in selective marketing, decision analysis, and business management. A significant amount of research effort has been elaborated upon the development of efficient algorithms for data mining. However, without fully considering the timevariant characteristics of items and transactions, it is noted that some discovered rules may be expired from users' interest. In other words, some discovered knowledge may be obsolete and of little use, especially when we perform the mining schemes on a transaction database of short life cycle products. This aspect is, however, rarely addressed in prior studies. To remedy this, we broaden in this paper the horizon of frequent pattern mining by introducing a weighted model of transaction-weighted association rules in a time-variant database. Specifically, we propose an efficient Progressive Weighted Miner (abbreviatedly as PWM ) algorithm to perform the mining for this problem as well as conduct the corresponding performance studies. In algorithm PWM, the importance of each transaction period is first reflected by a proper weight assigned by the user. Then, PWM partitions the time-variant database in light of weighted periods of transactions and performs weighted mining. Algorithm PWM is designed to progressively accumulate the itemset counts based on the intrinsic partitioning characteristics and employ a filtering threshold in each partition to early prune out those cumulatively infrequent 2-itemsets. With this design, algorithm PWM is able to efficiently produce weighted association rules for applications where different time periods are assigned with different weights and lead to results of more interest.

Models learned from data are often subject to some degree of uncertainty, for a variety of resoans. In classification, ensembles of models provide a useful means of averaging out error introduced by individual classifiers, hence reducing the generalization error of prediction.The plurality voting method is often chosen for bagging, because of its simplicity of implementation. However, the plurality approach to model reconciliation is ad-hoc. There are many other voting methods to choose from, including the anti-plurality method, the plurality method with elimination, the Borda count method, and Condorcet's method of pairwise comparisons. Any of these could lead to a better method for reconciliation.In this paper, we analyze the use of these voting methods in model reconciliation. We present empirical results comparing performance of these voting methods when applied in bagging. These results include some surprises, and among other things suggest that (1) plurality is not always the best voting method; (2) the number of classes can affect the performance of voting methods; and (3) the degree of dataset noise can affect the performance of voting methods. While it is premature to make final judgments about specific voting methods, the results of this work raise interesting questions, and they open the door to the application of voting theory in classification theory.

We propose mixtures of hidden Markov models for modelling clickstreams of web surfers. Hence, the page categorization is learned from the data without the need for a (possibly cumbersome) manual categorization. We provide an EM algorithm for training a mixture of HMMs and show that additional static user data can be incorporated easily to possibly enhance the labelling of users. Furthermore, we use prior knowledge to enhance generalization and avoid numerical problems. We use parameter tying to decrease the danger of over tting and to reduce computational overhead. We put a at prior on the parameters to deal with the problem that certain transitions between page categories occur very seldom or not at all, in order to ensure that a nonzero transition probability between these categories nonetheless remains. In applications to arti cial data and real-world web logs we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach. We train a mixture of HMMs on arti cial navigation patterns, and show that the correct model is being learned. Moreover, we show that the use of static 'satellite data' may enhance the labeling of shorter navigation patterns. When applying a mixture of HMMs to realworld web logs from a large Dutch commercial web site, we demonstrate that sensible page categorizations are being learned.

Markov models and their variations, or models based on sequence mining have been found well suited for this problem. However, higher order Markov models are extremely complicated due to their large number of states whereas lower order Markov models do not capture the entire behavior of a user in a session. The models that are based on sequential pattern mining only consider the frequent sequences in the data set, making it difficult to predict the next request following a page that is not in the sequential pattern. Furthermore, it is hard to find models for mining two different kinds of information of a user session. We propose a new model that considers both the order information of pages in a session and the time spent on them. We cluster user sessions based on their pair-wise similarity and represent the resulting clusters by a click-stream tree. The new user session is then assigned to a cluster based on a similarity measure. The click-stream tree of that cluster is used to generate the recommendation set. The model can be used as part of a cache prefetching system as well as a recommendation model. Copyright 2003 ACM.

Examples of variables for which such orders exist include terms in documents, courses in enrollment data, and paleontological sites in fossil data collections. The observations in such applications are flat, unordered sets; however, the data sets respect the underlying ordering of the variables. By this we mean that if A ≺ B ≺ C are three variables respecting the underlying ordering ≺, and both of variables A and C appear in an observation, then, up to noise levels, variable B also appears in this observation. Similarly, if A1 ≺ A2 ≺ … ≺ Al-1 ≺ Ai is a longer sequence of variables, we do not expect to see many observations for which there are indices i < j < k such that Ai and Ak occur in the observation but Aj does not.In this paper we study the problem of discovering fragments of orders of variables implicit in collections of unordered observations. We define measures that capture how well a given order agrees with the observed data. We describe a simple and efficient algorithm for finding all the fragments that satisfy certain conditions. We also discuss the sometimes necessary postprocessing for selecting only the best fragments of order. Also, we relate our method with a sequencing approach that uses a spectral algorithm, and with the consecutive ones problem. We present experimental results on some real data sets (author lists of database papers, exam results data, and paleontological data).

DNA microarray provides a powerful basis for analysis of gene expression. Data mining methods such as clustering have been widely applied to microarray data to link genes that show similar expression patterns. However, this approach usually fails to unveil gene-gene interactions in the same cluster. Association rule mining and loglinear models have been used for this purpose, but their inherent limitations as well as information loss due to discretization limit the applicability of the results. Here we propose the use of a Graphical Gaussian Model to discover pairwise gene interactions. We have constructed a prototype system that permits rapid interactive exploration of gene relationships; results can be validated by experts or known information, or suggest new experiments. We have tested our methodology using the yeast microarray data. Our results reveal some previously unknown interactions that have solid biological explanations.

Projected clustering has become a hot research topic due to its ability to cluster high-dimensional data. However, most existing projected clustering algorithms depend on some critical user parameters in determining the relevant attributes of each cluster. In case wrong parameter values are used, the clustering performance will be seriously degraded. Unfortunately, correct parameter values are rarely known in real datasets. In this paper, we propose a projected clustering algorithm that does not depend on user inputs in determining relevant attributes. It responds to the clustering status and adjusts the internal thresholds dynamically. From experimental results, our algorithm shows a much higher usability than the other projected clustering algorithms used in our comparison study. It also works well with a gene expression dataset for studying lymphoma. The high usability of the algorithm and the encouraging results suggest that projected clustering can be a practical tool for analyzing gene expression pro les.

This paper makes three contributions to the study of relational learning. (1) It presents a hierarchy of relational concepts of increasing complexity, using relational schema characteristics such as cardinality, and derives classes of aggregation operators that are needed to learn these concepts.

(3) It demonstrates empirically on a noisy business domain that more-complex aggregation methods can increase generalization performance. Constructing features using target-dependent aggregations can transform relational prediction tasks so that well-understood feature-vector-based modeling algorithms can be applied successfully.

Data streams are incremental tasks that require incremental, online, and any-time learning algorithms. One of the most successful algorithms for mining data streams is VFDT. In this paper we extend the VFDT system in two directions: the ability to deal with continuous data and the use of more powerful classification techniques at tree leaves. The proposed system, VFDTc, can incorporate and classify new information online, with a single scan of the data, in time constant per example. The most relevant property of our system is the ability to obtain a performance similar to a standard decision tree algorithm even for medium size datasets. This is relevant due to the any-time property. We study the behaviour of VFDTc in different problems and demonstrate its utility in large and medium data sets. Under a bias-variance analysis we observe that VFDTc in comparison to C4.5 is able to reduce the variance component.

Feature selection is a frequently used technique in pre-processing high-dimensional data for successful data mining. Traditionally, feature selection is focused on removing irrelevant features. However, for high-dimensional data, removing redundant features is equally critical. In this paper, we provide a study of feature redundancy in high-dimensional data and propose a novel correlation-based approach to feature selection within the filter model. The extensive empirical study using real-world data shows that the proposed approach is efficient and effective in removing redundant and irrelevant features.

Consequently, the knowledge embedded in a data stream is more likely to be changed as time goes by. Identifying the recent change of a data stream, specially for an online data stream, can provide valuable information for the analysis of the data stream. In addition, monitoring the continuous variation of a data stream enables to find the gradual change of embedded knowledge. However, most of mining algorithms over a data stream do not differentiate the information of recently generated transactions from the obsolete information of old transactions which may be no longer useful or possibly invalid at present. This paper proposes a data mining method for finding recent frequent itemsets adaptively over an online data stream. The effect of old transactions on the mining result of the data steam is diminished by decaying the old occurrences of each itemset as time goes by. Furthermore, several optimization techniques are devised to minimize processing time as well as main memory usage. Finally, the proposed method is analyzed by a series of experiments.

These techniques often rely on statistical models based on trial performance data. This trial performance data is typically obtained by soliciting a smaller sample of the possible prospect pool. Collecting this trial data involves a cost; therefore the fundraiser is interested in keeping the trial size small while still collecting enough data to build a reliable statistical model that will be used to evaluate the remainder of the prospects.We describe an experimental design approach to optimally choose the trial prospects from an existing large pool of prospects. Prospects are clustered to render the problem practically tractable. We modify the standard D-optimality algorithm to prevent repeated selection of the same prospect cluster, since each prospect can only be solicited at most once.We assess the benefits of this approach on the KDD-98 data set by comparing the performance of the model based on the optimal trial data set with that of a model based on a randomly selected trial data set of equal size.

The goal is to steer the mining focus to those significant relationships involving items with significant weights rather than being flooded in the combinatornal explosion of insignificant relationships. We identify the challenge of using weights in the iterative process of generating large itemsets. The problem of invalidation of the ""downward closure property"" in the weighted setting is solved by using an improved model of weighted support measurements and exploiting a ""weighted downward closure property"". A new algorithm called WARM (Weighted Association Rule Mining) is developed based on the improved model. The algorithm is both scalable and efficient in discovering significant relationships in weighted settings as illustrated by experiments performed on simulated datasets."

We show that a simple nested loop algorithm that in the worst case is quadratic can give near linear time performance when the data is in random order and a simple pruning rule is used. We test our algorithm on real high-dimensional data sets with millions of examples and show that the near linear scaling holds over several orders of magnitude. Our average case analysis suggests that much of the efficiency is because the time to process non-outliers, which are the majority of examples, does not depend on the size of the data set.

This paper considers the use of computational stylistics for performing authorship attribution of electronic messages, addressing categorization problems with as many as 20 different classes (authors). E ective stylistic characterization of text is potentially useful for a variety of tasks, as language style contains cues regarding the authorship, purpose, and mood of the text, all of which would be useful adjuncts to information retrieval or knowledge-management tasks. We focus here on the problem of determining the author of an anonymous message, based only on the message text. Several multiclass variants of the Winnow algorithm were applied to a vector representation of the message texts to learn models for discriminating di erent authors. We present results comparing the classi cation accuracy of the di erent approaches. The results show that stylistic models can be accurately learned to determine an author's identity.

Most existing approaches have relied on generic or manually tuned distance metrics for estimating the similarity of potential duplicates. In this paper, we present a framework for improving duplicate detection using trainable measures of textual similarity. We propose to employ learnable text distance functions for each database field, and show that such measures are capable of adapting to the specific notion of similarity that is appropriate for the field's domain. We present two learnable text similarity measures suitable for this task: an extended variant of learnable string edit distance, and a novel vector-space based measure that employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for training. Experimental results on a range of datasets show that our framework can improve duplicate detection accuracy over traditional techniques.

Keywords Web-mining+clustering+divide-and-conquer	This paper describes a novel algorithm and deployed system Golden Path Analyzer (GPA) that analyzes clickstreams of people trying to complete the same task on a website. It finds the shortest, successful paths taken by users - 'golden paths' - and uses these as seeds for clickstream clusters. Other users are assigned to a cluster if their clickstream is a supersequence of the golden path. The advantages of this approach are that the resulting clusters are easily comprehended, they are few in number, correspond to semantically different strategies used by the users, and jointly partition all the clickstreams. GPA's key contribution over prior work in process funnels is that by not excluding users that make diversions from the golden path, GPA is able to assign more users to fewer clusters. Another key contribution is to use actual full clickstreams as cluster seeds to which supersequences of other users are added. Golden paths correspond to complete clickstreams that are based on actual user page transitions. GPA is particularly useful for site designers to improve processes such as shopping, returns and registration. Its analyses identify which web pages cause many users to deviate from a golden path, which links distract users and the percentage of users taking each golden path. GPA has demonstrated value on more than twenty client projects in diverse industries.

Our specific area of interest is the efficient retrieval and analysis of trajectory similarities. Trajectory datasets are very common in environmental applications, mobility experiments, video surveillance and are especially important for the discovery of certain biological patterns. Our primary similarity measure is based on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS) model, that offers enhanced robustness, particularly for noisy data, which are encountered very often in real world applications. However, our index is able to accommodate other distance measures as well, including the ubiquitous Euclidean distance, and the increasingly popular Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). While other researchers have advocated one or other of these similarity measures, a major contribution of our work is the ability to support all these measures without the need to restructure the index. Our framework guarantees no false dismissals and can also be tailored to provide much faster response time at the expense of slightly reduced precision/recall. The experimental results demonstrate that our index can help speed-up the computation of expensive similarity measures such as the LCSS and the DTW.

We extend our previous work [1] of the general framework for video data mining to further address the issue such as how to mine video data. To extract motions, we use an accumulation of quantized pixel differences among all frames in a video segment. As a result, the accumulated motions of segment are represented as a two dimensional matrix. Further, we develop how to capture the location of motions occurring in a segment using the same matrix generated for the calculation of the amount. We study how to cluster those segmented pieces using the features (the amount and the location of motions) we extract by the matrix above. We investigate an algorithm to find whether a segment has normal or abnormal events by clustering and modeling normal events, which occur mostly. In addition to deciding normal or abnormal, the algorithm computes Degree of Abnormality of a segment, which represents to what extent a segment is distant to the existing segments in relation with normal events. Our experimental studies indicate that the proposed techniques are promising.

Our ultimate goal is to track changes over time in such communities. For such temporal tracking, we require a clustering algorithm that is relatively stable under small perturbations of the input data. We have developed an efficient, scalable agglomerative strategy and applied it to the citation graph of the NEC CiteSeer database (250,000 papers; 4.5 million citations). Agglomerative clustering techniques are known to be unstable on data in which the community structure is not strong. We find that some communities are essentially random and thus unstable while others are natural and will appear in most clusterings. These natural communities will enable us to track the evolution of communities over time.

A natural model for multi-variate directional data is provided by the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on the unit hypersphere that is analogous to the multi-variate Gaussian distribution in Rd. In this paper, we propose modeling complex directional data as a mixture of vMF distributions. We derive and analyze two variants of the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework for estimating the parameters of this mixture. We also propose two clustering algorithms corresponding to these variants. An interesting aspect of our methodology is that the spherical kmeans algorithm (kmeans with cosine similarity) can be shown to be a special case of both our algorithms. Thus, modeling text data by vMF distributions lends theoretical validity to the use of cosine similarity which has been widely used by the information retrieval community. As part of experimental validation, we present results on modeling high-dimensional text and gene-expression data as a mixture of vMF distributions. The results indicate that our approach yields superior clusterings especially for difficult clustering tasks in high-dimensional spaces.

A novel theoretical formulation views the contingency table as an empirical joint probability distribution of two discrete random variables and poses the co-clustering problem as an optimization problem in information theory---the optimal co-clustering maximizes the mutual information between the clustered random variables subject to constraints on the number of row and column clusters. We present an innovative co-clustering algorithm that monotonically increases the preserved mutual information by intertwining both the row and column clusterings at all stages. Using the practical example of simultaneous word-document clustering, we demonstrate that our algorithm works well in practice, especially in the presence of sparsity and high-dimensionality.

As a widely used data mining technique, outlier detection is a process which aims to find anomalies while providing good explanations. Most existing detection methods are basically designed for numeric data, however, real-life data such as web pages, business transactions and bioinformatics records always contain categorical data. So it causes difficulty to find reasonable exceptions in the real world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel outlier mining method based on hypergraph model for categorical data. Since hypergraphs precisely capture the distribution characteristics in data subspaces, this method is effective in identifying anomalies in dense subspaces and presents good interpretations for the local outlierness. By selecting the most relevant subspaces, the problem of ”curse of dimensionality” in very large databases can also be ameliorated. Furthermore, the connectivity property is used to replace the distance metrics, so that the distance-based computation is not needed anymore, which enhances the robustness for handling missing-value data. The fact that connectivity computation facilitates the aggregation operations supported by most SQL-compatible database systems, makes the mining process much efficient. Finally, we give experiments and analysis which show that our method can find outliers in categorical data with good performance and quality. The work is partially supported by the National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant No. G1998030414 and the National Research Foundation for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China under Grant No. 99038 yThe author is partially supported by Microsoft Research Fellowship.

Apart from the main content blocks, it usually has such blocks as navigation panels, copyright and privacy notices, and advertisements (for business purposes and for easy user access). We call these blocks that are not the main content blocks of the page the noisy blocks. We show that the information contained in these noisy blocks can seriously harm Web data mining. Eliminating these noises is thus of great importance. In this paper, we propose a noise elimination technique based on the following observation: In a given Web site, noisy blocks usually share some common contents and presentation styles, while the main content blocks of the pages are often diverse in their actual contents and/or presentation styles. Based on this observation, we propose a tree structure, called Style Tree, to capture the common presentation styles and the actual contents of the pages in a given Web site. By sampling the pages of the site, a Style Tree can be built for the site, which we call the Site Style Tree (SST). We then introduce an information based measure to determine which parts of the SST represent noises and which parts represent the main contents of the site. The SST is employed to detect and eliminate noises in any Web page of the site by mapping this page to the SST. The proposed technique is evaluated with two data mining tasks, Web page clustering and classification. Experimental results show that our noise elimination technique is able to improve the mining results significantly.

A major task of traditional temporal event sequence mining is to nd all frequent event patterns from a long temporal sequence.

In this paper, we consider the problem of e cient mining of temporal event sequences which lead to an instance of a speci c type of event. Temporal constraints are used to ensure sensibility of the mining results. We will rst generalise and formalise the problem of event-oriented temporal sequence data mining. After discussing some unique issues in this new problem, we give a set of criteria, which are adapted from traditional data mining techniques, to measure the quality of patterns to be discovered.

The search is difficult because potential replacements may differ from the original and from each other by one or more parameters. Worse still, the cumbersome nature of this process may cause the engineers to miss appropriate solutions amid the many thousands of parts listed in industry catalogs.In this paper, we address this problem by introducing the notion of a parametric ""distance"" between electronic components. We use this distance to search a large parts data set and recommend likely replacements. Recommendations are based on an adaptive nearest-neighbor search through the parametric data set. For each user, we learn how to scale the axes of the feature space in which the nearest neighbors are sought.

We show how both the accuracy and privacy impact of a hypothetical system could be substantially improved, and we discuss the necessary and sufficient conditions for this improvement to be achieved. This analysis is neither a defense nor a critique of any particular system concept. Rather, our model suggests alternative technical designs that could mitigate some concerns, but also raises more specific conditions that must be met for such systems to be both accurate and socially desirable.

Recently, there has been much interest in mining streaming data. Domingos and Hulten have presented a one-pass algorithm for decision tree construction. Their work uses Hoeffding inequality to achieve a probabilistic bound on the accuracy of the tree constructed.In this paper, we revisit this problem. We make the following two contributions: 1) We present a numerical interval pruning (NIP) approach for efficiently processing numerical attributes. Our results show an average of 39% reduction in execution times. 2) We exploit the properties of the gain function entropy (and gini) to reduce the sample size required for obtaining a given bound on the accuracy. Our experimental results show a 37% reduction in the number of data instances required.

In the past, Earth scientists have used observation and, more recently, eigenvalue analysis techniques, such as principal components analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD), to discover climate indices. However, eigenvalue techniques are only useful for finding a few of the strongest signals. Furthermore, they impose a condition that all discovered signals must be orthogonal to each other, making it difficult to attach a physical interpretation to them. This paper presents an alternative clustering-based methodology for the discovery of climate indices that overcomes these limitiations and is based on clusters that represent regions with relatively homogeneous behavior. The centroids of these clusters are time series that summarize the behavior of the ocean or atmosphere in those regions. Some of these centroids correspond to known climate indices and provide a validation of our methodology; other centroids are variants of known indices that may provide better predictive power for some land areas; and still other indices may represent potentially new Earth science phenomena. Finally, we show that cluster based indices generally outperform SVD derived indices, both in terms of area weighted correlation and direct correlation with the known indices.

The method relies equally on rigorous search strategies and on human interaction. At each step, the method conservatively ""shaves off"" a fraction of the database tuples and attributes, so that most of the correlations present in the data are not affected by the decomposition. Instead, the correlations become more obvious to the user, because they are hidden in a much smaller portion of the database. This process can be repeated iteratively and interactively, until only the most important correlations remain.The main technical difficulty of the approach is figuring out how to ""shave off"" part of the database so as to preserve most correlations. We develop an algorithm for this problem that has a polynomial running time and guarantees result quality."

In an earlier work, we formalized the idea of approximately repeated subsequences by introducing the notion of time series motifs. Two limitations of this work were the poor scalability of the motif discovery algorithm, and the inability to discover motifs in the presence of noise.Here we address these limitations by introducing a novel algorithm inspired by recent advances in the problem of pattern discovery in biosequences. Our algorithm is probabilistic in nature, but as we show empirically and theoretically, it can find time series motifs with very high probability even in the presence of noise or ""don't care"" symbols. Not only is the algorithm fast, but it is an anytime algorithm, producing likely candidate motifs almost immediately, and gradually improving the quality of results over time."

Both the expert system and the learning system represent information by logical decision rules or trees. Unlike the classical views of knowledge-base evaluation or refinement, our view accepts the contents of the knowledge base as completely correct. The knowledge base and the results of its stored cases will provide direction for the discovery of new relationships in the form of newly induced decision rules. An expert system called SEAS was built to discover sales leads for computer products and solutions. The system interviews executives by asking questions, and based on the responses, recommends products that may improve a business' operations. Leveraging this expert system, we record the results of the interviews and the program's recommendations. The very same data stored by the expert system is used to find new predictive rules. Among the potential advantages of this approach are (a) the capability to spot new sales trends and (b) the substitution of less expensive probabilistic rules that use database data instead of interviews.

However, despite the prominent properties of SVMs, they are not as favored for large-scale data mining as for pattern recognition or machine learning because the training complexity of SVMs is highly dependent on the size of a data set. Many real-world data mining applications involve millions or billions of data records where even multiple scans of the entire data are too expensive to perform. This paper presents a new method, Clustering-Based SVM (CB-SVM), which is specifically designed for handling very large data sets. CB-SVM applies a hierarchical micro-clustering algorithm that scans the entire data set only once to provide an SVM with high quality samples that carry the statistical summaries of the data such that the summaries maximize the benefit of learning the SVM. CB-SVM tries to generate the best SVM boundary for very large data sets given limited amount of resources. Our experiments on synthetic and real data sets show that CB-SVM is highly scalable for very large data sets while also generating high classification accuracy.

Simple anomaly detection and signature detection based models have been implemented on the NIC firmware, which has its own processor and memory. We empirically evaluate such systems from the perspective of quality and performance (bandwidth of acceptable messages) under varying conditions of host load. The preliminary results we obtain are very encouraging and lead us to believe that such NIC-based security schemes could very well be a crucial part of next generation network security systems.

Such datasets, which frequently arise in a wide variety of applications, pose some of the most significant challenges in data analysis. Subsampling and compression are two key technologies for analyzing these datasets. PROXIMUS provides a technique for reducing large datasets into a much smaller set of representative patterns, on which traditional (expensive) analysis algorithms can be applied with minimal loss of accuracy. We show desirable properties of PROXIMUS in terms of runtime, scalability to large datasets, and performance in terms of capability to represent data in a compact form. We also demonstrate applications of PROXIMUS in association rule mining. In doing so, we establish PROXIMUS as a tool for preprocessing data before applying computationally expensive algorithms or as a tool for directly extracting correlated patterns. Our experimental results show that use of the compressed data for association rule mining provides excellent precision and recall values (near 100%) across a range of support thresholds while reducing the time required for association rule mining drastically.

Our weather-forecast generator is currently operational and being used daily by a meteorological company. We generate summaries in three steps: (a) selecting the most important trends and patterns to communicate; (b) mapping these patterns onto words and phrases; and (c) generating actual texts based on these words and phrases. In this paper we focus on the first step, (a), selecting the information to communicate, and describe how we perform this using modified versions of standard data analysis algorithms such as segmentation. The modifications arose out of empirical work with users and domain experts, and in fact can all be regarded as applications of the Gricean maxims of Quality, Quantity, Relevance, and Manner, which describe how a cooperative speaker should behave in order to help a hearer correctly interpret a text. The Gricean maxims are perhaps a key element of adapting data analysis algorithms for effective communication of information to human users, and should be considered by other researchers interested in communicating data to human users.

However, corporations change prices based on proprietary algorithms and hidden variables (e.g., the number of unsold seats on a flight). Is it possible to develop data mining techniques that will enable consumers to predict price changes under these conditions?This paper reports on a pilot study in the domain of airline ticket prices where we recorded over 12,000 price observations over a 41 day period. When trained on this data, Hamlet --- our multi-strategy data mining algorithm --- generated a predictive model that saved 341 simulated passengers $198,074 by advising them when to buy and when to postpone ticket purchases. Remarkably, a clairvoyant algorithm with complete knowledge of future prices could save at most $320,572 in our simulation, thus HAMLET's savings were 61.8% of optimal. The algorithm's savings of $198,074 represents an average savings of 23.8% for the 341 passengers for whom savings are possible. Overall, HAMLET saved 4.4% of the ticket price averaged over the entire set of 4,488 simulated passengers. Our pilot study suggests that mining of price data available over the web has the potential to save consumers substantial sums of money per annum.

Classification is an important problem in the data mining domain, but current classification methods for XML documents use IR-based methods in which each document is treated as a bag of words. Such techniques ignore a significant amount of information hidden inside the documents. In this paper we discuss the problem of rule based classification of XML data by using frequent discriminatory substructures within XML documents. Such a technique is more capable of finding the classification characteristics of documents. In addition, the technique can also be extended to cost sensitive classification. We show the effectiveness of the method with respect to other classifiers. We note that the methodology discussed in this paper is applicable to any kind of semi-structured data.

As a general data structure, graph can model complicated relations among data with wide applications in bioinformatics, Web exploration, and etc. However, mining large graph patterns in challenging due to the presence of an exponential number of frequent subgraphs. Instead of mining all the subgraphs, we propose to mine closed frequent graph patterns. A graph g is closed in a database if there exists no proper supergraph of g that has the same support as g. A closed graph pattern mining algorithm, CloseGraph, is developed by exploring several interesting pruning methods. Our performance study shows that CloseGraph not only dramatically reduces unnecessary subgraphs to be generated but also substantially increases the efficiency of mining, especially in the presence of large graph patterns.

Recently, motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target?We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most influential nodes is NP-hard here, and we provide the first provable approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions, we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63% of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of influence problems in social networks.We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees, our approximation algorithms significantly out-perform node-selection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the field of social networks."

Recommender systems use collaborative filtering to recommend items by summarizing the preferences of people who have tendencies similar to the user preference. Traditionally, the degree of preference is represented by a scale, for example, one that ranges from one to five. This type of measuring technique is called the semantic differential (SD) method. Web adopted the ranking method, however, rather than the SD method, since the SD method is intrinsically not suited for representing individual preferences. In the ranking method, the preferences are represented by orders, which are sorted item sequences according to the users' preferences. We here propose some methods to recommed items based on these order responses, and carry out the comparison experiments of these methods.

In this paper, we propose two algorithms, one greedy and the other stochastic, designed for program specific code restructuring as a means of increasing spatial locality within a program. Both algorithms effectively decrease average working set size and hence the page fault rate. Our methods are more effective than traditional approaches due to use of domain information. We illustrate the efficacy of our algorithms on actual data mining algorithms.

Blocking methods are used in record linkage systems to reduce the number of candidate record comparison pairs to a feasible number whilst still maintaining linkage accuracy. Blocking methods partition the data sets into blocks or clusters of records which share a blocking attribute or are otherwise similar with respect to a defined criterion. We compare two new blocking methods, bigram indexing and canopy clustering with TFIDF (Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency), with two older methods of standard traditional blocking and sorted neighbourhood blocking. The results show that recently blocking methods such as bigram indexing and canopy clustering provide scalable blocking methods while maintaining or improving upon record linkage accuracy. There is a potential for large performance speed-ups and better accuracy to be achieved by these new blocking methods.

While most of the previous studies focus on clustering either genes or samples, it is interesting to ask whether we can partition the complete set of samples into exclusive groups (called phenotypes) and find a set of informative genes that can manifest the phenotype structure. In this paper, we propose a new problem of simultaneously mining phenotypes and informative genes from gene expression data. Some statistics-based metrics are proposed to measure the quality of the mining results. Two interesting algorithms are developed: the heuristic search and the mutual reinforcing adjustment method. We present an extensive performance study on both real-world data sets and synthetic data sets. The mining results from the two proposed methods are clearly better than those from the previous methods. They are ready for the real-world applications. Between the two methods, the mutual reinforcing adjustment method is in general more scalable, more effective and with better quality of the mining results.

This structuring allows existing patient records to be mined for quality assurance, regulatory compliance, and to relate financial and clinical factors.

The issues of mining these data sets are not just their sizes, but also the distributed nature. The complication is that communicating all the data to a central database would be too slow. To reduce communication costs, one could compress the data during transmission. Another method is random sampling. We propose an approach for distributed multivariate regression based on sampling and discuss its relationship with the compression method. The central idea is motivated by the observation that, although communication is limited, each individual site can still scan and process all the data it holds. Thus it is possible for the site to communicate only influential samples without seeing data in other sites. We exploit this observation and derive a method that provides tradeoff between communication cost and accuracy. Experimental results show that it is better than the compression method and random sampling.

That is why we proposed STIFF (SpatioTemporal Integrated Forecasting Framework) in previous work [11], trying to answer such a challenging problem of doing forecasting in natural environment with both spatial and temporal characteristics involved. However, despite its promising performance on univariate-based data, STIFF is not sophisticated enough for more complicated environmental data derived from multiple correlated variables. Therefore in this paper we add multivariate analysis to the solution, take the correlation between different variables into account and further extend STIFF to address spatiotemporal forecasting involving multiple variables. Our experiments show that this introduction and integration of multivariate correlation not only has a more reasonable and rational interpretation of the data itself, but also produces a higher accuracy and slightly more balanced behavior.

The pioneering work on the spatial scan statistic is often used as the basis to detect and evaluate such clusters. State-of-the-art systems based on this approach detect clusters with restrictive shapes that cannot model growth and shifts in location over time. We extend these methods significantly by using the flexible square pyramid shape to model such effects. A heuristic search method is developed to detect the most likely clusters using a randomized algorithm in combination with geometric shapes processing. The use of Monte Carlo methods in the original scan statistic formulation is continued in our work to address the multiple hypothesis testing issues. Our method is applied to a real data set on brain cancer occurrences over a 19 year period. The cluster detected by our method shows both growth and movement which could not have been modeled with the simpler cylindrical shapes used earlier. Our general framework can be extended quite easily to handle other flexible shapes for the space-time clusters.

Keywords+Graph mining+index+graph database+frequent graph	Mining frequent structural patterns from graph databases is an interesting problem with broad applications. Most of the previous studies focus on pruning unfruitful search subspaces effectively, but few of them address the mining on large, disk-based databases. As many graph databases in applications cannot be held into main memory, scalable mining of large, disk-based graph databases remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we develop an effective index structure, ADI (for <u>ad</u>jacency <u>i</u>ndex), to support mining various graph patterns over large databases that cannot be held into main memory. The index is simple and efficient to build. Moreover, the new index structure can be easily adopted in various existing graph pattern mining algorithms. As an example, we adapt the well-known gSpan algorithm by using the ADI structure. The experimental results show that the new index structure enables the scalable graph pattern mining over large databases. In one set of the experiments, the new disk-based method can mine graph databases with one million graphs, while the original gSpan algorithm can only handle databases of up to 300 thousand graphs. Moreover, our new method is faster than gSpan when both can run in main memory.

An example of such a pattern can associate contaminated water reservoirs with certain deceases in their spatial neighborhood. Previous work on discovering collocation patterns converts neighborhoods of feature instances to itemsets and applies mining techniques for transactional data to discover the patterns. We propose a method that combines the discovery of spatial neighborhoods with the mining process. Our technique is an extension of a spatial join algorithm that operates on multiple inputs and counts long pattern instances. As demonstrated by experimentation, it yields significant performance improvements compared to previous approaches.

Its sibling from the unsupervised world, the probabilistic mixture of multinomial models, has likewise been successfully applied to text clustering problems. Despite the strong independence assumptions that these models make, their attractiveness come from low computational cost, relatively low memory consumption, ability to handle heterogeneous features and multiple classes, and often competitiveness with the top of the line models. Recently, there has been several attempts to alleviate the problems of Naive Bayes by performing heuristic feature transformations, such as IDF, normalization by the length of the documents and taking the logarithms of the counts. We justify the use of these techniques and apply them to two problems: classification of products in Yahoo! Shopping and clustering the vectors of collocated terms in user queries to Yahoo! Search. The experimental evaluation allows us to draw conclusions about the promise that these transformations carry with regard to alleviating the strong assumptions of the multinomial model.

We address the case of vertically partitioned data -- multiple data owners/agencies each possess a few attributes of every data record. We focus on the case of the agencies wanting to conduct a linear regression analysis with complete records without disclosing values of their own attributes. This paper describes an algorithm that enables such agencies to compute the exact regression coefficients of the global regression equation and also perform some basic goodness-of-fit diagnostics while protecting the confidentiality of their data. In more general settings beyond the privacy scenario, this algorithm can also be viewed as method for the distributed computation for regression analyses.
5B41B5CA	Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	soumen chakrabarti	2004	Discovering links between lexical and surface features in questions and answers	indexation + machine learning + information retrieval system + question answering system + feature vector		Information retrieval systems, based on keyword match, are evolving to question answering systems that return short passages or direct answers to questions, rather than URLs pointing to whole pages. Most open-domain question answering systems depend on manually designed hierarchies of question types. A question is first classified to a fixed type, and then hand-engineered rules associated with the type yield keywords and/or predictive annotations that are likely to match indexed answer passages. Here we seek a more data-driven approach, assisted by machine learning. We propose a simple log-linear model over a pair of feature vectors, one derived from the question and the other derived from the a candidate passage. Features are extracted using a lexical network and surface context as in named entity extraction, except that there is no direct supervision available in the form of fixed entity types and their examples. Using the log-linear model, we filter candidate passages and see substantial improvement in the mean rank at which the first answer is found. The model parameters distill and reveal linguistic artifacts coupling questions and their answers, which can be used for better annotation and indexing.

The shopping list prediction is one aspect of a larger system we have developed for retailers to provide individual and personalized interactions with customers as they navigate through the retail store. Instead of using traditional personalization approaches, such as clustering or segmentation, we learn separate classifiers for each customer from historical transactional data. This allows us to make very fine-grained and accurate predictions about what items a particular individual customer will buy on a given shopping trip.We formally frame the shopping list prediction as a classification problem, describe the algorithms and methodology behind our system, its impact on the business case in which we frame it, and explore some of the properties of the data source that make it an interesting testbed for KDD algorithms. Our results show that we can predict a shopper's shopping list with high levels of accuracy, precision, and recall. We believe that this work impacts both the data mining and the retail business community. The formulation of shopping list prediction as a machine learning problem results in algorithms that should be useful beyond retail shopping list prediction. For retailers, the result is not only a practical system that increases revenues by up to 11%, but also enhances customer experience and loyalty by giving them the tools to individually interact with customers and anticipate their needs.

Detection of near duplicate documents is an important problem in many data mining and information filtering applications. When faced with massive quantities of data, traditional duplicate detection techniques relying on direct interdocument similarity computation (e.g., using the cosine measure) are often not feasible given the time and memory performance constraints. On the other hand, fingerprint-based methods, such as I-Match, are very attractive computationally but may be brittle with respect to small changes to document content. We focus on approaches to nearreplica detection that are based upon large-collection statistics and present a general technique of increasing their robustness via multiple lexicon randomization. In experiments with large web-page and spam-email datasets the proposed method is shown to consistently outperform traditional I-Match, with the relative improvement in duplicatedocument recall reaching as high as 40-60%. The large gains in detection accuracy are offset by only small increases in computational requirements.

Moreover+by fixing	Existing data mining algorithms on graphs look for nodes satisfying specific properties, such as specific notions of structural similarity or specific measures of link-based importance. While such analyses for predetermined properties can be effective in well-understood domains, sometimes identifying an appropriate property for analysis can be a challenge, and focusing on a single property may neglect other important aspects of the data. In this paper, we develop a foundation for mining the properties themselves. We present a theoretical framework defining the space of graph properties, a variety of mining queries enabled by the framework, techniques to handle the enormous size of the query space, and an experimental system called F-Miner that demonstrates the utility and feasibility of property mining.

While complex matchings are common, because of their far more complex search space, most existing techniques focus on simple 1:1 matchings. To tackle this challenge, this paper takes a conceptually novel approach by viewing schema matching as correlation mining, for our task of matching Web query interfaces to integrate the myriad databases on the Internet. On this ""deep Web,"" query interfaces generally form complex matchings between attribute groups (e.g., [author] corresponds to [first name, last name] in the Books domain). We observe that the co-occurrences patterns across query interfaces often reveal such complex semantic relationships: grouping attributes (e.g., [first name, last name]) tend to be co-present in query interfaces and thus positively correlated. In contrast, synonym attributes are negatively correlated because they rarely co-occur. This insight enables us to discover complex matchings by a correlation mining approach. In particular, we develop the DCM framework, which consists of data preparation, dual mining of positive and negative correlations, and finally matching selection. Unlike previous correlation mining algorithms, which mainly focus on finding strong positive correlations, our algorithm cares both positive and negative correlations, especially the subtlety of negative correlations, due to its special importance in schema matching. This leads to the introduction of a new correlation measure, $H$-measure, distinct from those proposed in previous work. We evaluate our approach extensively and the results show good accuracy for discovering complex matchings."

Unlike previous approaches to CQF, which estimate the consensus opinion of a group of reviewers, our algorithm uses a generative model of the review process to estimate the latent intrinsic quality of the items under reviews. We run several tests that demonstrate that consensus and intrinsic quality are, in fact different and unrelated aspects of quality. These results suggest that asymptotic consensus, which purports to model peer review, is, in fact, not recovering the ground truth quality of reviewed items.

Specifically we consider the following three tasks in topic trend analysis: 1)Topic Structure Identification; identifying what kinds of main topics exist and how important they are, 2)Topic Emergence Detection; detecting the emergence of a new topic and recognizing how it grows, 3)Topic Characterization; identifying the characteristics for each of main topics. For real topic analysis systems, we may require that these three tasks be performed in an on-line fashion rather than in a retrospective way, and be dealt with in a single framework. This paper proposes a new topic analysis framework which satisfies this requirement from a unifying viewpoint that a topic structure is modeled using a finite mixture model and that any change of a topic trend is tracked by learning the finite mixture model dynamically. In this framework we propose the usage of a time-stamp based discounting learning algorithm in order to realize real-time topic structure identification. This enables tracking the topic structure adaptively by forgetting out-of-date statistics. Further we apply the theory of dynamic model selection to detecting changes of main components in the finite mixture model in order to realize topic emergence detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using real data collected at a help desk to show that we are able to track dynamics of topic trends in a timely fashion.

The focus has been primarily on developing measures and applications based on data collected from content, structure and usage of Web until a particular time instance. In this project we examine another dimension of Web Mining, namely temporal dimension. Web data has been evolving over time, reflecting the ongoing trends. These changes in data in the temporal dimension reveal new kind of information. This information has not captured the attention of the Web mining research community to a large extent. In this paper, we highlight the significance of studying the evolving nature of the Web graphs. We have classified the approach to such problems at three levels of analysis: single node, sub-graphs and whole graphs. We provide a framework to approach problems in this kind of analysis and identify interesting problems at each level. Our experiments verify the significance of such an analysis and also point to future directions in this area. The approach we take is generic and can be applied to other domains, where data can be modeled as a graph, such as network intrusion detection or social networks.

Automatic content extraction, classification and content-based retrieval have become highly desired goals for the development of intelligent remote sensing databases. The common approach for mining these databases uses rules created by analysts. However, incorporating GIS information and human expert knowledge with digital image processing improves remote sensing image analysis. We developed a system that uses decision tree classifiers for interactive learning of land cover models and mining of image archives. Decision trees provide a promising solution for this problem because they can operate on both numerical (continuous) and categorical (discrete) data sources, and they do not require any assumptions about neither the distributions nor the independence of attribute values. This is especially important for the fusion of measurements from different sources like spectral data, DEM data and other ancillary GIS data. Furthermore, using surrogate splits provides the capability of dealing with missing data during both training and classification, and enables handling instrument malfunctions or the cases where one or more measurements do not exist for some locations. Quantitative and qualitative performance evaluation showed that decision trees provide powerful tools for modeling both pixel and region contents of images and mining of remote sensing image archives.

Predictor functions are almost always learned on a set of highly correlated data comprising a very small segment of predictor space. Moreover, flexible predictors, by their very nature, are not controlled at points of extrapolation. This becomes a problem for diagnostic tools that require evaluation on a product distribution. It is also an issue when we are trying to optimize a response over some variable in the input space. Finally, it can be a problem in non-static systems in which the underlying predictor distribution gradually drifts with time or when typographical errors misrecord the values of some predictors.We present a diagnosis for extrapolation as a statistical test for a point originating from the data distribution as opposed to a null hypothesis uniform distribution. This allows us to employ general classification methods for estimating such a test statistic. Further, we observe that CART can be modified to accept an exact distribution as an argument, providing a better classification tool which becomes our extrapolation-detection procedure. We explore some of the advantages of this approach and present examples of its practical application.

Every mechanical structure is defined by the set of finite elements that are called structure elements. Large-scale complex structures may have extremely large number of structure elements, and predicting the failure in every single element using the original set of natural frequencies as features is exceptionally time-consuming task. Traditional data mining techniques simply predict failure in each structure element individually using global prediction models that are built considering all data records. In order to reduce the time complexity of these models, we propose a localized clustering-regression based approach that consists of two phases: (1) building a local cluster around a data record of interest and (2) predicting an intensity of damage only in those structure elements that correspond to data records from the built cluster. For each test data record, we first build a cluster of data records from training data around it. Then, for each data record that belongs to discovered cluster, we identify corresponding structure elements and we build a localized regression model for each of these structure elements. These regression models for specific structure elements are constructed using only a specific set of relevant natural frequencies and merely those data records that correspond to the failure of that structure element. Experiments performed on the problem of damage prediction in a large electric transmission tower frame indicate that the proposed localized clustering-regression based approach is significantly more accurate and more computationally efficient than our previous hierarchical clustering approach, as well as global prediction models.

The goal is to classify these individuals using the observed metabolite levels for 317 measured metabolites. There are a number of statistical challenges: non-normal data, the number of samples is less than the number of metabolites; there are missing data and the fact that data are missing is informative (assay values below detection limits can point to a specific class); also, there are high correlations among the metabolites. We investigate support vector machines (SVM), and random forest (RF), for outlier detection, variable selection and classification. We use the variables selected with RF in SVM and visa versa. The benefit of this study is insight into interplay of variable selection and classification methods. We link our selected predictors to the biochemistry of the disease."

One obstacle for the applicability of frequent-set mining is that the size of the output collection can be far too large to be carefully examined and understood by the users. Even restricting the output to the border of the frequent item-set collection does not help much in alleviating the problem.In this paper we address the issue of overwhelmingly large output size by introducing and studying the following problem: What are the k sets that best approximate a collection of frequent item sets? Our measure of approximating a collection of sets by k sets is defined to be the size of the collection covered by the the k sets, i.e., the part of the collection that is included in one of the k sets. We also specify a bound on the number of extra sets that are allowed to be covered. We examine different problem variants for which we demonstrate the hardness of the corresponding problems and we provide simple polynomial-time approximation algorithms. We give empirical evidence showing that the approximation methods work well in practice.

Unsupervised identification of patterns in microarray data has been a productive approach to uncovering relationships between genes and the biological process in which they are involved. Traditional model-based clustering approaches as well as some recently developed model-based mining approaches for integrating genomic and functional genomic data rely on one's ability to determine the correct number of clusters or modules in the data. In this paper we demonstrate that the performance of such methods in general can be significantly improved by accounting for uncertainties inherent to the process of identifying the optimal number of clusters in the data. We demonstrate that the Bayesian averaging approach to clustering via infinite mixture model offers a more robust performance than the traditional finite mixture model in which the optimal number of clusters is determined using the Bayesian Information Criterion. This performance improvement is demonstrated through a simulation study and by the analysis of a relatively large microarray dataset. Finally, we describe the novel heuristic modification of the Gibbs sampler used to fit the infinite mixture mode that effectively deals with issues of slow mixing.

Populating the data warehouse is a laborious and time-consuming task (especially for small projects), which is – in practice – a big obstacle for concrete ECRM projects. Especially if Web usage analysis researchers need to conduct experiments with a Web warehouse, an intuitive and easy to deploy ETL component is essential. In this paper we propose a logical object-oriented relational data storage model in UML, which is based on a formal model. A concrete Java instance of our model simplifies modeling and automating the ETL process. The Java instance of our model has been integrated into our WUSAN (Web USage ANalyis) system. Finally, we illustrate the usage of our model for Web usage analysis purposes, though the model is principally not restricted to this domain.

However, when the number of items and transactions are large, the computation cost of this query can be very high. In this paper, we identify an upper bound of Pearson's correlation coefficient for binary variables. This upper bound is not only much cheaper to compute than Pearson's correlation coefficient but also exhibits a special monotone property which allows pruning of many item pairs even without computing their upper bounds. A Two-step All-strong-Pairs corrElation que Ry (TAPER) algorithm is proposed to exploit these properties in a filter-and-refine manner. Furthermore, we provide an algebraic cost model which shows that the computation savings from pruning is independent or improves when the number of items is increased in data sets with common Zipf or linear rank-support distributions. Experimental results from synthetic and real data sets exhibit similar trends and show that the TAPER algorithm can be an order of magnitude faster than brute-force alternatives.

Storylines are windows that offer glimpses into interesting themes latent among the top search results for a query; they are different from, and complementary to, clusters obtained through traditional approaches. Our framework is axiomatically developed and combinatorial in nature, based on generalizations of the maximum induced matching problem on bipartite graphs. The core algorithmic task involved is to mine for signature structures in a robust graph representation of the search results. We present a very fast algorithm for this task based on local search. Experiments show that the collection of storylines extracted through our algorithm offers a concise organization of the wealth of information hidden beyond the first page of search results.

AV consists of three components: Model Service for design time, Business Intelligence Entity (BIE) for programming model, and IntellDrill for runtime navigation between OLTP and OLAP data sources. AV feature-set fulfills enterprise application requirements for Analysis and Decision Support, complementing the transactional feature-set currently provided by MBF. Model Service automatically transforms an ""object oriented model (transactional view)"" to a ""multi-dimensional model (analytical view)"" without the traditional Extraction/Transformation/Loading (ETL) overhead and complexity. It infers dimensionality from the object layer where richer metadata is stored, eliminating the ""guesswork"" that a traditional data warehousing process requires when going through physical database schema. BI Entities are classes code-generated by Model Service. As an intrinsic part of the framework, BI Entities enable a consistent object oriented way of programming model with strong types and rich semantics for OLAP, similar to what MBF object persistence technology does for OLTP data. More importantly, data contained in BI Entities have a higher degree of ""application awareness,"" such as the integrated application level security and customizability. IntelliDrill links together all the information islands in MBF using metadata. Because of the automatic transformation from transactional view to analytical view enabled by Model Service, we have the ability to understand natively what kind of drill-ability an object would have, thus making information navigation in MBF fully discover-able with built-in ontology."

In order to guarantee the performance of data mining and the protection of individual privacy, optimal randomization schemes need to be employed. This paper demonstrates the construction of optimal randomization schemes for privacy preserving density estimation. We propose a general framework for randomization using mixture models. The impact of randomization on data mining is quantified by performance degradation and mutual information loss, while privacy and privacy loss are quantified by interval-based metrics. Two different types of problems are defined to identify optimal randomization for PPDM. Illustrative examples and simulation results are reported.

By making large media repositories searchable, semantic content descriptions greatly enhance the value of such data. Automatic semantic understanding is a very challenging problem and most media databases resort to describing content in terms of low-level features or using manually ascribed annotations. Recent techniques focus on detecting semantic concepts in video, such as indoor, outdoor, face, people, nature, etc. This approach works for a fixed lexicon for which annotated training examples exist. In this paper we consider the problem of using such semantic concept detection to map the video clips into semantic spaces. This is done by constructing a model vector that acts as a compact semantic representation of the underlying content. We then present experiments in the semantic spaces leveraging such information for enhanced semantic retrieval, classification, visualization, and data mining purposes. We evaluate these ideas using a large video corpus and demonstrate significant performance gains in retrieval effectiveness.

In the literature, a well-known dimension reduction scheme is Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The common aspect of previously proposed LDA based algorithms is the use of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Due to the difficulty of designing an incremental solution for the eigenvalue problem on the product of scatter matrices in LDA, there is little work on designing incremental LDA algorithms. In this paper, we propose an LDA based incremental dimension reduction algorithm, called IDR/QR, which applies QR Decomposition rather than SVD. Unlike other LDA based algorithms, this algorithm does not require the whole data matrix in main memory. This is desirable for large data sets. More importantly, with the insertion of new data items, the IDR/QR algorithm can constrain the computational cost by applying efficient QR-updating techniques. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the IDR/QR algorithm in terms of classification accuracy on the reduced dimensional space. Our experiments on several real-world data sets reveal that the accuracy achieved by the IDR/QR algorithm is very close to the best possible accuracy achieved by other LDA based algorithms. However, the IDR/QR algorithm has much less computational cost, especially when new data items are dynamically inserted.

In fact, the current model of the classification problem simply concentrates on methods for one-pass classification modeling of very large data sets. Our model for data stream classification views the data stream classification problem from the point of view of a dynamic approach in which simultaneous training and testing streams are used for dynamic classification of data sets. This model reflects real life situations effectively, since it is desirable to classify test streams in real time over an evolving training and test stream. The aim here is to create a classification system in which the training model can adapt quickly to the changes of the underlying data stream. In order to achieve this goal, we propose an on-demand classification process which can dynamically select the appropriate window of past training data to build the classifier. The empirical results indicate that the system maintains a high classification accuracy in an evolving data stream, while providing an efficient solution to the classification task.

General Terms+Algorithms. Keywords+Semi-supervised Clustering+Hidden Markov Random Fields+Distance Metric Learning	Unsupervised clustering can be significantly improved using supervision in the form of pairwise constraints, i.e., pairs of instances labeled as belonging to same or different clusters. In recent years, a number of algorithms have been proposed for enhancing clustering quality by employing such supervision. Such methods use the constraints to either modify the objective function, or to learn the distance measure. We propose a probabilistic model for semi-supervised clustering based on Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRFs) that provides a principled framework for incorporating supervision into prototype-based clustering. The model generalizes a previous approach that combines constraints and Euclidean distance learning, and allows the use of a broad range of clustering distortion measures, including Bregman divergences (e.g., Euclidean distance and I-divergence) and directional similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity). We present an algorithm that performs partitional semi-supervised clustering of data by minimizing an objective function derived from the posterior energy of the HMRF model. Experimental results on several text data sets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework.

The objective of personalized search is to provide users with information tailored to their individual contexts. We propose to personalize Web search based on features extracted from hyperlinks, such as anchor terms or URL tokens. Our methodology personalizes PageRank vectors by weighting links based on the match between hyperlinks and user profiles. In particular, here we describe a profile representation using Internet domain features extracted from URLs. Users specify interest profiles as binary vectors where each feature corresponds to a set of one or more DNS tree nodes. Given a profile vector, a weighted PageRank is computed assigning a weight to each URL based on the match between the URL and the profile. We present promising results from an experiment in which users were allowed to select among nine URL features combining the top two levels of the DNS tree, leading to 29 pre-computed PageRank vectors from a Yahoo crawl. Personalized PageRank performed favorably compared to pure similarity based ranking and traditional PageRank.

Our driving application is 'network tomography', where we need to estimate the origin-destination (OD) traffic flows to determine, e.g., who is communicating with whom in a local area network. This information allows network engineers and managers to solve problems in design, routing, configuration debugging, monitoring and pricing. Unfortunately the direct measurement of the OD traffic is usually difficult, or even impossible; instead, we can easily measure the loads on every link, that is, sums of desirable OD flows.In this paper we propose i-FILTER, a method to solve this problem, which improves the state-of-the-art by (a) introducing explicit time dependence, and by (b) using realistic, non-Gaussian marginals in the statistical models for the traffic flows, as never attempted before. We give experiments on real data, where i-FILTER scales linearly with new observations and out-performs the best existing solutions, in a wide variety of settings. Specifically, on real network traffic measured at CMU, and at AT&T, i-FILTER reduced the estimation errors between 15% and 46% in all cases.

In this paper we study the complexity-theoretic aspects of maximal frequent itemset mining, from the perspective of counting the number of solutions. We present the first formal proof that the problem of counting the number of distinct maximal frequent itemsets in a database of transactions, given an arbitrary support threshold, is #P-complete, thereby providing strong theoretical evidence that the problem of mining maximal frequent itemsets is NP-hard. This result is of particular interest since the associated decision problem of checking the existence of a maximal frequent itemset is in P.We also extend our complexity analysis to other similar data mining problems dealing with complex data structures, such as sequences, trees, and graphs, which have attracted intensive research interests in recent years. Normally, in these problems a partial order among frequent patterns can be defined in such a way as to preserve the downward closure property, with maximal frequent patterns being those without any successor with respect to this partial order. We investigate several variants of these mining problems in which the patterns of interest are subsequences, subtrees, or subgraphs, and show that the associated problems of counting the number of maximal frequent patterns are all either #P-complete or #P-hard.

Identifying such early buyers can help personalize marketing strategies, potentially improving their effectiveness. In this paper, we present a non-parametric approach to the problem of identifying early buyers from purchase data. Our formulation takes as inputs the detailed purchase information of each consumer, with which we construct a weighted directed graph whose nodes correspond to consumers and whose edges correspond to purchases consumers have in common; the edge weights indicate how frequently consumers purchase products earlier than other consumers.Identifying early buyers corresponds to the problem of finding a subset of nodes in the graph with maximum difference between the weights of the outgoing and incoming edges. This problem is a variation of the maximum cut problem in a directed graph. We provide an approximation algorithm based on semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations pioneered by Goemans and Williamson, and analyze its performance. We apply the algorithm to real purchase data from Amazon.com, providing new insights into consumer behaviors.

Keywords Multi–Task Learning+Support Vector Machines+Regular- ization+Kernel Methods	Past empirical work has shown that learning multiple related tasks from data simultaneously can be advantageous in terms of predictive performance relative to learning these tasks independently. In this paper we present an approach to multi--task learning based on the minimization of regularization functionals similar to existing ones, such as the one for Support Vector Machines (SVMs), that have been successfully used in the past for single--task learning. Our approach allows to model the relation between tasks in terms of a novel kernel function that uses a task--coupling parameter. We implement an instance of the proposed approach similar to SVMs and test it empirically using simulated as well as real data. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than existing multi--task learning methods and largely outperforms single--task learning using SVMs.

In this paper, we propose a simple generalization of SVM: Weighted Margin SVM (WMSVMs) that permits the incorporation of prior knowledge. We show that Sequential Minimal Optimization can be used in training WMSVM. We discuss the issues of incorporating prior knowledge using this rather general formulation. The experimental results show that the proposed methods of incorporating prior knowledge is effective.

We analyze this network to show that it is a small-world network with significant clustering. We also present a spectral algorithm which clusters newsgroups based on the cross-post matrix. The result of our clustering provides a topical classification of newsgroups. Our clustering gives many examples of significant relationships that would be missed by semantic clustering methods.

In the area of Intelligent Transport System (ITS), travel time prediction is an important subject. Probe-car system is an upcoming data collection method, in which a number of vehicles are used as moving sensors to detect actual traffic situation. It can collect data concerning much larger area, compared with traditional fixed detectors. Our prediction technique is based on statistical analysis using AR model with seasonal adjustment and MDL (Minimum Description Length) criterion. Seasonal adjustment is used to handle periodicities of 24 hours in traffic data. Alternatively, we employ state space model, which can handle time series with periodicities. It is important to select really effective data for prediction, among the data from widespread area, which are collected via probe-car system. We do this using MDL criterion. That is, we find the explanatory variables that really have influence on the future travel time. In this paper, we experimentally show effectiveness of our method using probe-car data collected in Nagoya Metropolitan Area in 2002.

In this paper we address a problem with frequent itemsets: that they only count rows where all their attributes are present, and do not allow for any noise. We show that generalizing the concept of frequency while preserving the performance of mining algorithms is nontrivial, and introduce a generalization of frequent itemsets, dense itemsets. Dense itemsets do not require all attributes to be present at the same time; instead, the itemset needs to define a sufficiently large submatrix that exceeds a given density threshold of attributes present.We consider the problem of computing all dense itemsets in a database. We give a levelwise algorithm for this problem, and also study the top-$k$ variations, i.e., finding the k densest sets with a given support, or the k best-supported sets with a given density. These algorithms select the other parameter automatically, which simplifies mining dense itemsets in an explorative way. We show that the concept captures natural facets of data sets, and give extensive empirical results on the performance of the algorithms. Combining the concept of dense itemsets with set cover ideas, we also show that dense itemsets can be used to obtain succinct descriptions of large datasets. We also discuss some variations of dense itemsets.

Furthermore, many more modern classifiers, such as kernel-based Bayes classifiers or the prediction phase of SVMs, require computational regimes similar to k-NN. We believe that tractable k-NN algorithms therefore continue to be important.This paper relies on the insight that even with many classes, the task of finding the majority class among the k nearest neighbors of a query need not require us to explicitly find those k nearest neighbors. This insight was previously used in (Liu et al., 2003) in two algorithms called KNS2 and KNS3 which dealt with fast classification in the case of two classes. In this paper we show how a different approach, IOC (standing for the International Olympic Committee) can apply to the case of n classes where n > 2.IOC assumes a slightly different processing of the datapoints in the neighborhood of the query. This allows it to search a set of metric trees, one for each class. During the searches it is possible to quickly prune away classes that cannot possibly be the majority.We give experimental results on datasets of up to 5.8 x 105 records and 1.5 x 103 attributes, frequently showing an order of magnitude acceleration compared with each of (i) conventional linear scan, (ii) a well-known independent SR-tree implementation of conventional k-NN and (iii) a highly optimized conventional k-NN metric tree search.

In our approach, with image feature grouping, a visual dictionary is created for color, texture, and shape feature attributes respectively. Labeling each training image with the keywords in the visual dictionary, a classification tree is built. Based on the statistical properties of the feature space we define a structure, called α-Semantics Graph, to discover the hidden semantic relationships among the semantic categories embodied in the image collection. With the α-Semantics Graph, each semantic category is modeled as a unique fuzzy set to explicitly address the semantic uncertainty and semantic overlap among the categories in the feature space. The model is utilized in the semantics-intensive image retrieval application. An algorithm using the classification accuracy measures is developed to combine the built classification tree with the fuzzy set modeling method to deliver semantically relevant image retrieval for a given query image. The experimental evaluations have demonstrated that the proposed approach models the semantic relationships effectively and the image retrieval prototype system utilizing the derived model is promising both in effectiveness and efficiency.

In this paper, we explore a novel type of gene-sample-time microarray data sets, which records the expression levels of various genes under a set of samples during a series of time points. In particular, we propose the mining of coherent gene clusters from such data sets. Each cluster contains a subset of genes and a subset of samples such that the genes are coherent on the samples along the time series. The coherent gene clusters may identify the samples corresponding to some phenotypes (e.g., diseases), and suggest the candidate genes correlated to the phenotypes. We present two efficient algorithms, namely the Sample-Gene Search and the Gene-Sample Search, to mine the complete set of coherent gene clusters. We empirically evaluate the performance of our approaches on both a real microarray data set and synthetic data sets. The test results have shown that our approaches are both efficient and effective to find meaningful coherent gene clusters.
NE8560	Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	David S. Vogel+Morgan C. Wang	2004	1-dimensional splines as building blocks for improving accuracy of risk outcomes models.	 + Machine learning + Computing methodologies	+prediction+adaptive+risk+outcomes	Transformation of both the response variable and the predictors is commonly used in fitting regression models. However, these transformation methods do not always provide the maximum linear correlation between the response variable and the predictors, especially when there are non-linear relationships between predictors and the response such as the medical data set used in this study. A spline based transformation method is proposed that is second order smooth, continuous, and minimizes the mean squared error between the response and each predictor. Since the computation time for generating this spline is O(n), the processing time is reasonable with massive data sets. In contrast to cubic smoothing splines, the resulting transformation equations also display a high level of efficiency for scoring. Data used for predicting health outcomes contains an abundance of non-linear relationships between predictors and the outcomes requiring an algorithm for modeling them accurately. Thus, a transformation that fits an adaptive cubic spline to each of a set of variables is proposed. These curves are used as a set of transformation functions on the predictors. A case study of how the transformed variables can be fed into a simple linear regression model to predict risk outcomes is presented. The results show significant improvement over the performance of the original variables in both linear and non-linear models.

Although several network management systems are available in the market, none of them have sufficient capabilities to detect faults in multi-tier Web-based systems with redundancy. We model a Web-based system as a weighted graph, where each node represents a ""service"" and each edge represents a dependency between services. Since the edge weights vary greatly over time, the problem we address is that of anomaly detection from a time sequence of graphs.In our method, we first extract a feature vector from the adjacency matrix that represents the activities of all of the services. The heart of our method is to use the principal eigenvector of the eigenclusters of the graph. Then we derive a probability distribution for an anomaly measure defined for a time-series of directional data derived from the graph sequence. Given a critical probability, the threshold value is adaptively updated using a novel online algorithm.We demonstrate that a fault in a Web application can be automatically detected and the faulty services are identified without using detailed knowledge of the behavior of the system."

The concordance index (CI) is a typical metric for quantifying the predictive ability of a survival model. We propose a new algorithm that directly uses the CI as the objective function to train a model, which predicts whether an event will eventually occur or not. Directly optimizing the CI allows the model to make complete use of the information from both censored and non-censored observations. In particular, we approximate the CI via a differentiable function so that gradient-based methods can be used to train the model. We applied the new algorithm to predict the eventual recurrence of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy. Compared with the traditional Cox proportional hazards model and several other algorithms based on neural networks and support vector machines, our algorithm achieves a significant improvement in being able to identify high-risk and low-risk groups of patients.

The point of entry of such part numbers into this process is normally via a Bill of Materials, or BOM, sent by a contact manufacturer or supplier. Each line of the BOM provides information about one part such as the supplier part number, the BOM receiver's corresponding internal part number, an unstructured textual part description, the supplier name, etc. However, in a substantial number of cases, the BOM receiver's internal part number is absent. Hence, before this part can be incorporated into the receiver's manufacturing process, it has to be mapped to an internal part (of the BOM receiver) based on the information of the part in the BOM. Historically, this mapping process has been done manually which is a highly time-consuming, labor intensive and error-prone process. This paper describes a system for automating the mapping of BOM part numbers. The system uses a two step modeling and mapping approach. First, the system uses historical BOM data, receiver's part specifications data and receiver's part taxonomic data along with domain knowledge to automatically learn classification models for mapping a given BOM part description to successively lower levels of the receiver's part taxonomy to reduce the set of potential internal parts to which the BOM part could map to. Then, information about various part parameters is extracted from the BOM part description and compared to the specifications data of the potential internal parts to choose the final mapped internal part. Mappings done by the system are very accurate, and the system is currently being deployed within IBM for mapping BOMs received by the corporate procurement/manufacturing divisions.

An arbitrary density function D, dependent on a region's total count C and total population P, can be used. For example, if each count represents the number of disease cases occurring in that square, we can use Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic DK to find the most significant spatial disease cluster. A naive approach to finding the maximum density region requires O(N4) time, and is generally computationally infeasible. We present a multiresolution algorithm which partitions the grid into overlapping regions using a novel overlap-kd tree data structure, bounds the maximum score of subregions contained in each region, and prunes regions which cannot contain the maximum density region. For sufficiently dense regions, this method finds the maximum density region in O((N log N)2) time, in practice resulting in significant (20-2000x) speedups on both real and simulated datasets.

Our approach relies on a committee of profile-specific neural networks. This approach provides recommendations that are accurate and fast to train because only the URLs relevant to a specific profile are used to define the architecture of each network. Similar to the task of completing the missing pieces of a puzzle, each neural network is trained to predict the missing URLs of several complete ground-truth sessions from a given profile, given as input several incomplete subsessions. We compare the proposed approach with collaborative filtering showing that our approach achieves higher coverage and precision while being faster, and requiring lower main memory at recommendation time. While most recommenders are inherently context sensitive, our approach is context ultra-sensitive because a different recommendation model is designed for each profile separately.

In this setting, two parties owning confidential databases wish to learn the structure of Bayesian network on the combination of their databases without revealing anything about their data to each other. We give an efficient and privacy-preserving version of the K2 algorithm to construct the structure of a Bayesian network for the parties' joint data.

General Terms Algorithms+Experimentation+Measurement Keywords Feature selection+data mining+astronomical survey+plasma physics+remote	Numerous applications of data mining to scientific data involve the induction of a classification model. In many cases, the collection of data is not performed with this task in mind, and therefore, the data might contain irrelevant or redundant features that affect negatively the accuracy of the induction algorithms. The size and dimensionality of typical scientific data make it difficult to use any available domain information to identify features that discriminate between the classes of interest. Similarly, exploratory data analysis techniques have limitations on the amount and dimensionality of the data they can process effectively. In this paper, we describe applications of efficient feature selection methods to data sets from astronomy, plasma physics, and remote sensing. We use variations of recently proposed filter methods as well as traditional wrapper approaches, where practical. We discuss the general challenges of feature selection in scientific datasets, the strategies for success that were common among our diverse applications, and the lessons learned in solving these problems.

One of the major research directions in this field is concerned with predictive data mining in graph databases where each instance is represented by a graph. Some of the proposed approaches for this task rely on the excellent classification performance of support vector machines. To control the computational cost of these approaches, the underlying kernel functions are based on frequent patterns. In contrast to these approaches, we propose a kernel function based on a natural set of cyclic and tree patterns independent of their frequency, and discuss its computational aspects. To practically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we use the popular NCI-HIV molecule dataset. Our experimental results show that cyclic pattern kernels can be computed quickly and offer predictive performance superior to recent graph kernels based on frequent patterns.

However, in many domains, including spam detection, intrusion detection, fraud detection, surveillance and counter-terrorism, this is far from the case: the data is actively manipulated by an adversary seeking to make the classifier produce false negatives. In these domains, the performance of a classifier can degrade rapidly after it is deployed, as the adversary learns to defeat it. Currently the only solution to this is repeated, manual, ad hoc reconstruction of the classifier. In this paper we develop a formal framework and algorithms for this problem. We view classification as a game between the classifier and the adversary, and produce a classifier that is optimal given the adversary's optimal strategy. Experiments in a spam detection domain show that this approach can greatly outperform a classifier learned in the standard way, and (within the parameters of the problem) automatically adapt the classifier to the adversary's evolving manipulations.

Recently, some researchers have studied the use of clickthrough data to adapt a search engine’s ranking function. Clickthrough data indicate for each query the results that are clicked by users. As a kind of implicit relevance feedback information, clickthrough data can easily be collected by a search engine. However, clickthrough data is sparse and incomplete, thus, it is a challenge to discover accurate user preferences from it. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called “Spy Naïve Bayes” (SpyNB) to identify user preferences generated from clickthrough data. First, we treat the result items clicked by the users as sure positive examples and those not clicked by the users as unlabelled data. Then, we plant the sure positive examples (the spies) into the unlabelled set of result items and apply a naïve Bayes classification to generate the reliable negative examples. These positive and negative examples allow us to discover more accurate user’s preferences. Finally, we employ the SpyNB algorithm with a ranking SVM optimizer to build an adaptive metasearch engine. Our experimental results show that, compared with the original ranking, SpyNB can significantly improve the average ranks of users’ click by 20%.

We first criticize this notion and point out that using old data blindly is not better than ""gambling""; in other words, it helps increase the accuracy only if we are ""lucky."" We discuss and analyze the situations where old data will help and what kind of old data will help. The practical problem on choosing the right example from old data is due to the formidable cost to compare different possibilities and models. This problem will go away if we have an algorithm that is extremely efficient to compare all sensible choices with little extra cost. Based on this observation, we propose a simple, efficient and accurate cross-validation decision tree ensemble method."

The problem of finding coClusters with specific properties is of interest, in particular, in the analysis of microarray experiments. In that case the entries of the matrix X are the expression levels of $m$ genes in each of $n$ tissue samples. One goal of the analysis is to extract a subset of the samples and a subset of the genes, such that the expression levels of the chosen genes behave similarly across the subset of the samples, presumably reflecting an underlying regulatory mechanism governing the expression level of the genes.We propose to base the similarity of the genes in a coCluster on a simple biological model, in which the strength of the regulatory mechanism in sample j is Hj, and the response strength of gene i to the regulatory mechanism is Gi. In other words, every two genes participating in a good coCluster should have expression values in each of the participating samples, whose ratio is a constant depending only on the two genes. Noise in the expression levels of genes is taken into account by allowing a deviation from the model, measured by a relative error criterion. The sleeve-width of the coCluster reflects the extent to which entry i,j in the coCluster is allowed to deviate, relatively, from being expressed as the product GiHj.We present a polynomial-time Monte-Carlo algorithm which outputs a list of coClusters whose sleeve-widths do not exceed a prespecified value. Moreover, we prove that the list includes, with fixed probability, a coCluster which is near-optimal in its dimensions. Extensive experimentation with synthetic data shows that the algorithm performs well.
NE8521	Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	Aleksander Kołcz+Abdur Chowdhury+Joshua Alspector	2004	Improved robustness of signature-based near-replica detection via lexicon randomization.	 + Information systems applications + Data mining + Information systems	No keyword found	Detection of near duplicate documents is an important problem in many data mining and information filtering applications. When faced with massive quantities of data, traditional duplicate detection techniques relying on direct inter-document similarity computation (e.g., using the cosine measure) are often not feasible given the time and memory performance constraints. On the other hand, fingerprint-based methods, such as I-Match, are very attractive computationally but may be brittle with respect to small changes to document content. We focus on approaches to near-replica detection that are based upon large-collection statistics and present a general technique of increasing their robustness via multiple lexicon randomization. In experiments with large web-page and spam-email datasets the proposed method is shown to consistently outperform traditional I-Match, with the relative improvement in duplicate-document recall reaching as high as 40-60%. The large gains in detection accuracy are offset by only small increases in computational requirements.

We present a new model for understanding scale-free networks based on multilevel geodesic approximation, using a new data structure called a multilevel mesh.Using this multilevel framework, we propose a new kind of graph clustering for data reduction of very large graph systems such as social, biological, or electronic networks. Finally, we apply our algorithms to real-world social networks and protein interaction graphs to show that they can reveal knowledge embedded in underlying graph structures. We also demonstrate how our data structures can be used to quickly answer approximate distance and shortest path queries on scale-free networks.

It is undesirable to mine sequential patterns from scratch each time when a small set of sequences grow, or when some new sequences are added into the database. Incremental algorithm should be developed for sequential pattern mining so that mining can be adapted to incremental database updates. However, it is nontrivial to mine sequential patterns incrementally, especially when the existing sequences grow incrementally because such growth may lead to the generation of many new patterns due to the interactions of the growing subsequences with the original ones. In this study, we develop an efficient algorithm, IncSpan, for incremental mining of sequential patterns, by exploring some interesting properties. Our performance study shows that IncSpan outperforms some previously proposed incremental algorithms as well as a non-incremental one with a wide margin.

Standard approaches, such as clustering of user sessions and discovering association rules or frequent navigational paths, do not generally provide the ability to automatically characterize or quantify the unobservable factors that lead to common navigational patterns. It is, therefore, necessary to develop techniques that can automatically discover hidden semantic relationships among users as well as between users and Web objects. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) is particularly useful in this context, since it can uncover latent semantic associations among users and pages based on the co-occurrence patterns of these pages in user sessions. In this paper, we develop a unified framework for the discovery and analysis of Web navigational patterns based on PLSA. We show the flexibility of this framework in characterizing various relationships among users and Web objects. Since these relationships are measured in terms of probabilities, we are able to use probabilistic inference to perform a variety of analysis tasks such as user segmentation, page classification, as well as predictive tasks such as collaborative recommendations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments performed on real-world data sets.

For example, collective inference could be used to simultaneously classify a set of hyperlinked documents or infer the legitimacy of a set of related financial transactions. Several recent studies indicate that collective inference can significantly reduce classification error when compared with traditional inference techniques. We investigate the underlying mechanisms for this error reduction by reviewing past work on collective inference and characterizing different types of statistical models used for making inference in relational data. We show important differences among these models, and we characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions for reduced classification error based on experiments with real and simulated data.

Most of the existing methods rank features according to their discriminative capability and then find a subset of discriminative genes (usually top k genes). In particular, t-statistic criterion and its variants have been adopted extensively. This kind of methods rely on the statistics principle of t-test, which requires that the data follows a normal distribution. However, according to our investigation, the normality condition often cannot be met in real data sets.To avoid the assumption of the normality condition, in this paper, we propose a rank sum test method for informative gene discovery. The method uses a rank-sum statistic as the ranking criterion. Moreover, we propose using the significance level threshold, instead of the number of informative genes, as the parameter. The significance level threshold as a parameter carries the quality specification in statistics. We follow the Pitman efficiency theory to show that the rank sum method is more accurate and more robust than the t-statistic method in theory.To verify the effectiveness of the rank sum method, we use support vector machine (SVM) to construct classifiers based on the identified informative genes on two well known data sets, namely colon data and leukemia data. The prediction accuracy reaches 96.2% on the colon data and 100% on the leukemia data. The results are clearly better than those from the previous feature ranking methods. By experiments, we also verify that using significance level threshold is more effective than directly specifying an arbitrary k.

Despite significant research, these methods have remained only loosely related. In this paper, we give an explicit theoretical connection between them. We show the generality of the weighted kernel k-means objective function, and derive the spectral clustering objective of normalized cut as a special case. Given a positive definite similarity matrix, our results lead to a novel weighted kernel k-means algorithm that monotonically decreases the normalized cut. This has important implications: a) eigenvector-based algorithms, which can be computationally prohibitive, are not essential for minimizing normalized cuts, b) various techniques, such as local search and acceleration schemes, may be used to improve the quality as well as speed of kernel k-means. Finally, we present results on several interesting data sets, including diametrical clustering of large gene-expression matrices and a handwriting recognition data set.

As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. For the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. In this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. This summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. Our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. This paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. Our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques.

Choosing suitable values for such parameters is a challenging problem.Cross-association is a joint decomposition of a binary matrix into disjoint row and column groups such that the rectangular intersections of groups are homogeneous. Starting from first principles, we furnish a clear, information-theoretic criterion to choose a good cross-association as well as its parameters, namely, the number of row and column groups. We provide scalable algorithms to approach the optimal. Our algorithm is parameter-free, and requires no user intervention. In practice it scales linearly with the problem size, and is thus applicable to very large matrices. Finally, we present experiments on multiple synthetic and real-life datasets, where our method gives high-quality, intuitive results."

Intelligence agencies are under increasing pressure to “connect the dots” between fragments of evidence from disparate sources to enable preemption of potential threats such as terrorist attacks. Most systems for threat detection in use today provide only data visualization tools for manual “link analysis,” leading to methods that do not scale to massive data sets. The CADRE system (Continuous Analysis and Discovery from Relational Evidence) addresses this deficiency by automating the link analysis process. CADRE combines an expressive knowledge representation of threat patterns with efficient, constraint-based abductive reasoning algorithms to automatically infer links and construct coherent threat hypotheses from structured data. A compact, factored representation of multiple hypotheses avoids redundant storage and enables scaling to large data sets. CADRE efficiently manages the growth of the hypotheses using probabilistic evaluation models and a consistency checking algorithm to prune unlikely hypotheses.

Massive publicly available gene expression data consisting of different experimental conditions and microarray platforms introduce new challenges in data mining when integrating multiple gene expression data. In this work, we proposed a metaclassification algorithm, which is called MIF algorithm, to perform multi-type cancer gene expression data classification. It uses regular histograms for gene expression levels of certain significant genes to represent sample profiles. Differences between profiles are then used to obtain dissimilarity measures and indicators of predictive classes. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm, 10 different data sets, which are individually published in 8 publications, are experimented. The results show that the MIF algorithm outperforms the simple majority-voting meta-classification algorithm and has a good meta-classification performance. In addition, we also compare our results with other researchers' works, and the comparisons are impressive. Finally, we have confirmed our findings with cancer/testis (CT) immunogenic gene families of heterogeneous samples.

Specifically, the support envelope for a transaction data set and a specified pair of positive integers (m,n) consists of the items and transactions that need to be searched to find any association pattern involving m or more transactions and n or more items. For any transaction data set with M transactions and N items, there is a unique lattice of at most M*N support envelopes that captures the structure of the association patterns in that data set. Because support envelopes are not encumbered by a support threshold, this support lattice provides a complete view of the association structure of the data set, including association patterns that have low support. Furthermore, the boundary of the support lattice---the support boundary---has at most min(M,N) envelopes and is especially interesting since it bounds the maximum sizes of potential association patterns---not only for frequent, closed, and maximal itemsets, but also for patterns, such as error-tolerant itemsets, that are more general. The association structure can be represented graphically as a two-dimensional scatter plot of the (m,n) values associated with the support envelopes of the data set, a feature that is useful in the exploratory analysis of association patterns. Finally, the algorithm to compute support envelopes is simple and computationally efficient, and it is straightforward to parallelize the process of finding all the support envelopes.

This makes the type of clusters identified highly dependent on the assumed similarity measure. Building on recent work in this area, we formally define a class of spatially varying dissimilarity measures and propose algorithms to learn the dissimilarity measure automatically from the data. The idea is to identify clusters that are compact with respect to the unknown spatially varying dissimilarity measure. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithms are more stable and achieve better accuracy on various textual data sets when compared with similar algorithms proposed in the literature.

Our Winnow-based algorithm continually monitors user and system behavior, recording such properties as the number of bytes transferred over the last 10 seconds, the programs that currently are running, and the load on the CPU. In all, hundreds of measurements are made and analyzed each second. Using this data, our algorithm creates a model that represents each particular computer's range of normal behavior. Parameters that determine when an alarm should be raised, due to abnormal activity, are set on a per-computer basis, based on an analysis of training data. A major issue in intrusion-detection systems is the need for very low false-alarm rates. Our empirical results suggest that it is possible to obtain high intrusion-detection rates (95%) and low false-alarm rates (less than one per day per computer), without ""stealing"" too many CPU cycles (less than 1%). We also report which system measurements are the most valuable in terms of detecting intrusions. A surprisingly large number of different measurements prove significantly useful."

In the present paper, we describe and evaluate a novel solution that treats these two important issues in a unified framework of Markov Decision Processes (MDP). In particular, we report on the results of a joint project between IBM Research and Saks Fifth Avenue to investigate the applicability of this technology to real world problems. The business problem we use as a testbed for our evaluation is that of optimizing direct mail campaign mailings for maximization of profits in the store channel. We identify a problem common to cross-channel CRM, which we call the Cross-Channel Challenge, due to the lack of explicit linking between the marketing actions taken in one channel and the customer responses obtained in another. We provide a solution for this problem based on old and new techniques in reinforcement learning. Our in-laboratory experimental evaluation using actual customer interaction data show that as much as 7 to 8 per cent increase in the store profits can be expected, by employing a mailing policy automatically generated by our methodology. These results confirm that our approach is valid in dealing with the cross channel CRM scenarios in the real world.

The accuracy is quantified using the PAC-MDL bound [3] in a semisupervised setting. Clustering algorithms which naturally separate the data according to (hidden) labels with a small number of clusters perform well. A simple extension of the argument leads to an objective model selection method. Experimental results on text analysis datasets demonstrate that this approach empirically results in very competitive bounds on test set performance on natural datasets.

We establish some theoretical guarantees concerning the performance of this method. In particular, we show that a certain variant possesses the boosting property, given a form of weak learning assumption on the component binary classifier. We also empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed method using benchmark data sets and verify that our method generally achieves better results than representative methods for cost-sensitive learning, in terms of predictive performance (cost minimization) and, in many cases, computational efficiency.

However in many applications this assumption is invalid. For example, lending institutions create models of who is likely to repay a loan from training sets consisting of people in their records to whom loans were given in the past; however, the institution approved loan applications previously based on who was thought unlikely to default. Learning from only approved loans yields an incorrect model because the training set is a biased sample of the general population of applicants. The issue of including rejected samples in the learning process, or alternatively using rejected samples to adjust a model learned from accepted samples only, is called reject inference.The main contribution of this paper is a systematic analysis of different cases that arise in reject inference, with explanations of which cases arise in various real-world situations. We use Bayesian networks to formalize each case as a set of conditional independence relationships and identify eight cases, including the familiar missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR) cases. For each case we present an overview of available learning algorithms. These algorithms have been published in separate fields of research, including epidemiology, econometrics, clinical trial evaluation, sociology, and credit scoring; our second major contribution is to describe these algorithms in a common framework.

To that end, we describe a framework for generalizing support that is based on the simple, but useful observation that support can be viewed as the composition of two functions: a function that evaluates the strength or presence of a pattern in each object (transaction) and a function that summarizes these evaluations with a single number. A key goal of any framework is to allow people to more easily express, explore, and communicate ideas, and hence, we illustrate how our support framework can be used to describe support for a variety of commonly used association patterns, such as frequent itemsets, general Boolean patterns, and error-tolerant itemsets. We also present two examples of the practical usefulness of generalized support. One example shows the usefulness of support functions for continuous data. Another example shows how the hyperclique pattern---an association pattern originally defined for binary data---can be extended to continuous data by generalizing a support function.

An accurate method would enable us, for example, to mine online opinions from the Internet and learn customers’ preferences for economic or marketing research, or for leveraging a strategic advantage. In this paper, we propose a two-stage Bayesian algorithm that is able to capture the dependencies among words, and, at the same time, finds a vocabulary that is efficient for the purpose of extracting sentiments. Experimental results on online movie reviews and online news show that our algorithm is able to select a parsimonious feature set with substantially fewer predictor variables than in the full data set and leads to better predictions about sentiment orientations than several state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Our findings suggest that sentiments are captured by conditional dependence relations among words, rather than by keywords or high-frequency words.

In Catalog Segmentation, the enterprise wants to design k product catalogs of size r that maximize the overall number of catalog products purchased. However, there are many applications where a customer, once attracted to an enterprise, would purchase more products beyond the ones contained in the catalog. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate an alternative problem formulation, that we call Customer-Oriented Catalog Segmentation, where the overall utility is measured by the number of customers that have at least a specified minimum interest t in the catalogs. We formally introduce the Customer-Oriented Catalog Segmentation problem and discuss its complexity. Then we investigate two different paradigms to design efficient, approximate algorithms for the Customer-Oriented Catalog Segmentation problem, greedy (deterministic) and randomized algorithms. Since greedy algorithms may be trapped in a local optimum and randomized algorithms crucially depend on a reasonable initial solution, we explore a combination of these two paradigms. Our experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data demonstrates that the new algorithms yield catalogs of significantly higher utility compared to classical Catalog Segmentation algorithms.

Such rules are particularly relevant for decision making from a business perspective. Motivated by market share rules, in this paper we consider statistical quantitative rules (SQ rules) that are quantitative rules in which the RHS can be any statistic that is computed for the segment satisfying the LHS of the rule. Building on prior work, we present a statistical approach for learning all significant SQ rules, i.e., SQ rules for which a desired statistic lies outside a confidence interval computed for this rule. In particular we show how resampling techniques can be effectively used to learn significant rules. Since our method considers the significance of a large number of rules in parallel, it is susceptible to learning a certain number of ""false"" rules. To address this, we present a technique that can determine the number of significant SQ rules that can be expected by chance alone, and suggest that this number can be used to determine a ""false discovery rate"" for the learning procedure. We apply our methods to online consumer purchase data and report the results."

We consider rich XML Web logs – called conceptual logs – that are generated by Web applications designed with the WebML conceptual model and developed with the WebRatio CASE tool. Conceptual logs integrate the usual information about user requests with meta-data concerning the structure of the content and the hypertext of a Web application. We apply a data mining language (MINE RULE) to conceptual logs in order to identify different types of patterns, such as: recurrent navigation paths, most frequently visited page contents, and anomalies (e.g., intrusion attempts or harmful usages of resources). We show that the exploitation of the nuggets of information embedded in the logs and of the specialized mining constructs provided by the query languages enables the rapid customization of the mining procedures following to the Web developers’ need. Given our on-field experience, we also suggest that the use of queries in advanced languages, as opposed to ad-hoc heuristics, eases the specification and the discovery of large spectrum of patterns.

Traditional information retrieval typically represents data using a bag of words; data mining typically uses a highly structured database representation. This paper explores the middle ground using a representation which we term entity models, in which questions about structured data may be posed and answered, but the complexities and task-specific restrictions of ontologies are avoided. An entity model is a language model or word distribution associated with an entity, such as a person, place or organization. Using these perentity language models, entities may be clustered, links may be detected or described with a short summary, entities may be collectively classified, and question answering may be performed. On a corpus of entities extracted from newswire and the Web, we group entities by profession with 90% accuracy, improve accuracy further on the task of classifying politicians as liberal or conservative using collective classification and conditional random fields, and answer questions about “who a person is” with mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 0.52.

A common operation on image databases is the retrieval of all images that are similar to a query image. For this, the images in the database are often represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space and a query is answered by retrieving all image vectors that are proximal to the query image in this space, under a suitable similarity metric. To overcome problems associated with high dimensionality, such as high storage and retrieval times, a dimension reduction step is usually applied to the vectors to concentrate relevant information in a small number of dimensions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a well-known dimension reduction scheme. However, since it works with vectorized representations of images, PCA does not take into account the spatial locality of pixels in images. In this paper, a new dimension reduction scheme, called Generalized Principal Component Analysis (GPCA), is presented. This scheme works directly with images in their native state, as two-dimensional matrices, by projecting the images to a vector space that is the tensor product of two lower-dimensional vector spaces. Experiments on databases of face images show that, for the same amount of storage, GPCA is superior to PCA in terms of quality of the compressed images, query precision, and computational cost.

We gathered 1971 benign and 1651 malicious executables and encoded each as a training example using n-grams of byte codes as features. Such processing resulted in more than 255 million distinct n-grams. After selecting the most relevant n-grams for prediction, we evaluated a variety of inductive methods, including naive Bayes, decision trees, support vector machines, and boosting. Ultimately, boosted decision trees outperformed other methods with an area under the roc curve of 0.996. Results also suggest that our methodology will scale to larger collections of executables. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the only fielded application for this task developed using techniques from machine learning and data mining.

In large graph databases, the total number of frequent subgraphs can become too large to allow a full enumeration using reasonable computational resources. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that mines only maximal frequent subgraphs, i.e. subgraphs that are not a part of any other frequent subgraphs. This may exponentially decrease the size of the output set in the best case; in our experiments on practical data sets, mining maximal frequent subgraphs reduces the total number of mined patterns by two to three orders of magnitude.Our method first mines all frequent trees from a general graph database and then reconstructs all maximal subgraphs from the mined trees. Using two chemical structure benchmarks and a set of synthetic graph data sets, we demonstrate that, in addition to decreasing the output size, our algorithm can achieve a five-fold speed up over the current state-of-the-art subgraph mining algorithms.

In this paper we introduce a new class of block constraints that determine the significance of an itemset pattern by considering the dense block that is formed by the pattern's items and its associated set of transactions. Block constraints provide a natural framework by which a number of important problems can be specified and make it possible to solve numerous problems on binary and real-valued datasets. However, developing computationally efficient algorithms to find these block constraints poses a number of challenges as unlike the different itemset-based constraints studied earlier, these block constraints are tough as they are neither anti-monotone, monotone, nor convertible. To overcome this problem, we introduce a new class of pruning methods that significantly reduce the overall search space and present a computationally efficient and scalable algorithm called CBMiner to find the closed itemsets that satisfy the block constraints.

Keywords+Tinplate quality+ANNs+CRISP-DM+FMEA	World steel trade becomes more competitive every day and new high international quality standards and productivity levels can only be achieved by applying the latest computational technologies. Data driven analysis of complex processes is necessary in many industrial applications where analytical modeling is not possible. This paper presents the deployment of KDD technology in one real industrial problem: the development of new tinplate quality diagnostic models.The electrodeposition of tin on steel strips is the most critical stage of a complex process that involves a great amount of variables and operating conditions. Its optimization is not only a great commercial and economic challenge but also a compulsion due to the social impact of the tinplate product-more than 90% of the production is used for food packaging. The necessary certification with standards, like ISO 9000, requires the use of diagnostic models to minimize the costs and the environmental impact. This aim has been achieved following the multi-stage DM methodology CRISP-DM and a novel application of pro-active maintenance methods, as FMEA, for the identification of the specific process anomalies. Three DM tools have been used for the development of the models. The final results include two ANN tinplate quality diagnostic models, that provide the estimated quality of the final product just seconds after its production and only based on the process data. The results have much better performance than the classical Faraday's models widely used for the estimation.

Machine learning approaches are frequently used to solve name entity (NE) recognition (NER). In this paper we propose a hybrid method that uses maximum entropy (ME) as the underlying machine learning method incorporated with dictionary-based and rule-based methods for post-processing. Simply using ME for NER, inaccurate boundary detection of NEs and misclassification may occur. Some NEs are partially recognized by ME. In the post-processing stage, we use dictionary-based and rule-based methods to extend boundary of partially recognized NEs and to adjust classification. We use GENIA corpus 3.01 to conduct 10-fold crossverification experiments. To evaluate the performance, we consider the longest NE annotations. We evaluate our approach using standard precision (P), recall (R), and F-score, where F-score is defined as 2PR/(P+R). The precision, recall and F-score ([P, R, F]) of our ME module for overall 23 categories is [0.512, 0.538, 0.525], and after the postprocessing the performance becomes [0.729, 0.711, 0.72] for [P, R, F]. For protein, DNA and RNA classes, our method achieves [P, R, F] of [0.77, 0.80, 0.785], [0.653, 0.748, 0.7], and [0.716, 0.788, 0.752], respectively. The post-processing stage significantly improves the performance of our MEbased NER module.

Comparative experimental evaluations in three different settings support our approach through consistent improvement of the results. An analysis of the results shows that this improvement is due to two separate effects.

There is an emerging trend in post-genome biology to study the collection of thousands of protein interaction pairs (protein interactome) derived from high-throughput experiments. However, high-throughput protein interactome data, especially when derived from the Yeast 2-Hybrid (Y2H) method, have been generally believed to be irreproducible and unreliable, with an estimated high “noise ratio” of more than 50%. In this work, we performed a comprehensive study on approximately 70,000 protein interactions derived from a systematic yeast 2-hybrid (SY2H) method. We performed a comprehensive analysis of biases, reproducibility, statistical significance, and biologically significant patterns in this data set. Surprisingly, we found these protein interactions have a much higher quality. The data represented a comprehensive survey of the entire human proteome with no chromosomal location bias. The reproducibility rate of interactions among replicated searches was quite good, i.e., at 78.5%. The false positive rate, 5.5e-5, was two orders of magnitude better than that reported elsewhere. We further developed several statistical measures and concluded that a protein interaction only needs to appear in two different SY2H searches to become significant. We also developed techniques to show supporting evidence that “promiscuous” protein interactions were not random noises; instead, they could be “network hubs” of the cell signaling network. We also attributed the low noise in our data to the adoption of standard control in the experimental data generation process.

While domain knowledge is always the best way to justify clustering, few clustering algorithms have ever take domain knowledge into consideration. In this paper, the domain knowledge is represented by hierarchical ontology. We develop a framework by directly incorporating domain knowledge into clustering process, yielding a set of clusters with strong ontology implication. During the clustering process, ontology information is utilized to efficiently prune the exponential search space of the subspace clustering algorithms. Meanwhile, the algorithm generates automatical interpretation of the clustering result by mapping the natural hierarchical organized subspace clusters with significant categorical enrichment onto the ontology hierarchy. Our experiments on a set of gene expression data using gene ontology demonstrate that our pruning technique driven by ontology significantly improve the clustering performance with minimal degradation of the cluster quality. Meanwhile, many hierarchical organizations of gene clusters corresponding to a sub-hierarchies in gene ontology were also successfully captured.

Keywords+time series+clustering+ARMA	Clustering time series is a problem that has applications in a wide variety of fields, and has recently attracted a large amount of research. In this paper we focus on clustering data derived from Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) models using k-means and k-medoids algorithms with the Euclidean distance between estimated model parameters. We justify our choice of clustering technique and distance metric by reproducing results obtained in related research. Our research aim is to assess the affects of discretising data into binary sequences of above and below the median, a process known as clipping, on the clustering of time series. It is known that the fitted AR parameters of clipped data tend asymptotically to the parameters for unclipped data. We exploit this result to demonstrate that for long series the clustering accuracy when using clipped data from the class of ARMA models is not significantly different to that achieved with unclipped data. Next we show that if the data contains outliers then using clipped data produces significantly better clusterings. We then demonstrate that using clipped series requires much less memory and operations such as distance calculations can be much faster. Finally, we demonstrate these advantages on three real world data sets.

There are many approaches to building such systems. Among them, using web access logs to generate users’ navigational models capable of building a web recommender system is a popular approach, given its non-intrusiveness. However, using only one information channel, namely the web access history, is often insufficient for accurate recommendation prediction. We therefore advocate the use of additional available information channels, such as the content of visited pages and the connectivity between web resources, to better model user navigational behavior. This helps in better modeling users’ concurrent information needs. In this chapter, we investigate a novel hybrid web recommender system, which combines access history and the content of visited pages, as well as the connectivity between web resources in a web site, to model users’ concurrent information needs and generate navigational patterns. Our experiments show that the combination of the three channels used in our system significantly improves the quality of web site recommendation and, further, that each additional channel used contributes to this improvement. In addition, we discuss cases on how to reach a compromise when not all channels are available.

It is often not feasible to compute a complete data cube due to the huge storage requirement. Recently proposed quotient cube addressed this issue through a partitioning method that groups cube cells into equivalence partitions. Such an approach is not only useful for distributive aggregate functions such as SUM but can also be applied to the holistic aggregate functions like MEDIAN.Maintaining a data cube for holistic aggregation is a hard problem since its difficulty lies in the fact that history tuple values must be kept in order to compute the new aggregate when tuples are inserted or deleted. The quotient cube makes the problem harder since we also need to maintain the equivalence classes. In this paper, we introduce two techniques called addset data structure and sliding window to deal with this problem. We develop efficient algorithms for maintaining a quotient cube with holistic aggregation functions that takes up reasonably small storage space. Performance study shows that our algorithms are effective, efficient and scalable over large databases.

Although this is true for many data mining, machine learning and statistical algorithms, this work shows it is feasible to get an efficient SQL implementation of the well-known K-means clustering algorithm that can work on top of a relational DBMS. The article emphasizes both correctness and performance. From a correctness point of view the article explains how to compute Euclidean distance, nearest-cluster queries and updating clustering results in SQL. From a performance point of view it is explained how to cluster large data sets defining and indexing tables to store and retrieve intermediate and final results, optimizing and avoiding joins, optimizing and simplifying clustering aggregations, and taking advantage of sufficient statistics. Experiments evaluate scalability with synthetic data sets varying size and dimensionality. The proposed K-means implementation can cluster large data sets and exhibits linear scalability.

Different criteria are appropriate in different settings, and it is not always clear which criteria to use. A further complication is that learning methods that perform well on one criterion may not perform well on other criteria. For example, SVMs and boosting are designed to optimize accuracy, whereas neural nets typically optimize squared error or cross entropy. We conducted an empirical study using a variety of learning methods (SVMs, neural nets, k-nearest neighbor, bagged and boosted trees, and boosted stumps) to compare nine boolean classification performance metrics: Accuracy, Lift, F-Score, Area under the ROC Curve, Average Precision, Precision/Recall Break-Even Point, Squared Error, Cross Entropy, and Probability Calibration. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) shows that these metrics span a low dimensional manifold. The three metrics that are appropriate when predictions are interpreted as probabilities: squared error, cross entropy, and calibration, lay in one part of metric space far away from metrics that depend on the relative order of the predicted values: ROC area, average precision, break-even point, and lift. In between them fall two metrics that depend on comparing predictions to a threshold: accuracy and F-score. As expected, maximum margin methods such as SVMs and boosted trees have excellent performance on metrics like accuracy, but perform poorly on probability metrics such as squared error. What was not expected was that the margin methods have excellent performance on ordering metrics such as ROC area and average precision. We introduce a new metric, SAR, that combines squared error, accuracy, and ROC area into one metric. MDS and correlation analysis shows that SAR is centrally located and correlates well with other metrics, suggesting that it is a good general purpose metric to use when more specific criteria are not known.

When mining temporal sequences, knowledge discovery techniques can be applied that discover interesting patterns of interactions. Existing approaches use frequency, and sometimes length, as measurements for interestingness. Because these are temporal sequences, additional characteristics, such as periodicity, may also be interesting. We propose that information theoretic principles can be used to evaluate interesting characteristics of time-ordered input sequences. In this paper, we present a novel data mining technique based on the Minimum Description Length principle that discovers interesting features in a time-ordered sequence. We discuss features of our real-time mining approach, show applications of the knowledge mined by the approach, and present a technique to bootstrap a decision maker from the mined patterns.

Co-clustering, or simultaneous clustering of rows and columns of a two-dimensional data matrix, is rapidly becoming a powerful data analysis technique. Co-clustering has enjoyed wide success in varied application domains such as text clustering, gene-microarray analysis, natural language processing and image, speech and video analysis. In this paper, we introduce a partitional co-clustering formulation that is driven by the search for a good matrix approximation-every co-clustering is associated with an approximation of the original data matrix and the quality of co-clustering is determined by the approximation error. We allow the approximation error to be measured using a large class of loss functions called Bregman divergences that include squared Euclidean distance and KL-divergence as special cases. In addition, we permit multiple structurally different co-clustering schemes that preserve various linear statistics of the original data matrix. To accomplish the above tasks, we introduce a new minimum Bregman information (MBI) principle that simultaneously generalizes the maximum entropy and standard least squares principles, and leads to a matrix approximation that is optimal among all generalized additive models in a certain natural parameter space. Analysis based on this principle yields an elegant meta algorithm, special cases of which include most previously known alternate minimization based clustering algorithms such as kmeans and co-clustering algorithms such as information theoretic (Dhillon et al., 2003b) and minimum sum-squared residue co-clustering (Cho et al., 2004).

Rare objects are often of great interest and great value. Until recently, however, rarity has not received much attention in the context of data mining. Now, as increasingly complex real-world problems are addressed, rarity, and the related problem of imbalanced data, are taking center stage. This article discusses the role that rare classes and rare cases play in data mining. The problems that can result from these two forms of rarity are described in detail, as are methods for addressing these problems. These descriptions utilize examples from existing research, so that this article provides a good survey of the literature on rarity in data mining. This article also demonstrates that rare classes and rare cases are very similar phenomena-both forms of rarity are shown to cause similar problems during data mining and benefit from the same remediation methods.

The ultimate goal of steganalysis is two-fold: making a binary classification of a file as stego-bearing or innocent, and secondly, locating the hidden message with an aim to extracting, sterilizing or manipulating it. Almost all steganalysis approaches (known as attacks) focus on the first of these two issues. In this paper, we explore the difficult related problem: given that we know an image file contains steganography, locate which pixels contain the message. We treat the hidden message location problem as outlier detection using probability/energy measures of images motivated by the image restoration community. Pixels contributing the most to the energy calculations of an image are deemed outliers. Typically, of the top third of one percent of most energized pixels (outliers), we find that 87% are stego-bearing in color images and 61% in grayscale images. In all image types only 1% of all pixels are stego-bearing indicating our techniques provides a substantial lift over random guessing.

Recent advances in the data quality field reflect the view that a database is the product of a manufacturing process. While routine errors, such as non-existent zip codes, can be detected and corrected using traditional data cleansing tools, many errors systemic to the manufacturing process cannot be addressed. Therefore, the product of the data manufacturing process is an imprecise recording of information about the entities of interest (i.e. customers, transactions or assets). In this way, the database is only one (flawed) version of the entities it is supposed to represent. Quality assurance systems such as Motorola's Six-Sigma and other continuous improvement methods document the data manufacturing process's shortcomings. A widespread method of documentation is quality matrices. In this paper, we explore the use of the readily available data quality matrices for the data mining classification task. We first illustrate that if we do not factor in these quality matrices, then our results for prediction are sub-optimal. We then suggest a general-purpose ensemble approach that perturbs the data according to these quality matrices to improve the predictive accuracy and show the improvement is due to a reduction in variance.

Subspace clustering is an extension of traditional clustering that seeks to ¯nd clusters in di®erent subspaces within a dataset. Often in high dimensional data, many dimensions are irrelevant and can mask existing clusters in noisy data. Feature selection removes irrelevant and redundant dimensions by analyzing the entire dataset. Subspace clustering algorithms localize the search for relevant dimensions allowing them to ¯nd clusters that exist in multiple, possibly overlapping subspaces. There are two major branches of subspace clustering based on their search strategy. Topdown algorithms ¯nd an initial clustering in the full set of dimensions and evaluate the subspaces of each cluster, iteratively improving the results. Bottom-up approaches ¯nd dense regions in low dimensional spaces and combine them to form clusters. This paper presents a survey of the various subspace clustering algorithms along with a hierarchy organizing the algorithms by their de¯ning characteristics. We then compare the two main approaches to subspace clustering using empirical scalability and accuracy tests and discuss some potential applications where subspace clustering could be particularly useful.

While it is feasible to recover association rules and preserve privacy using a straightforward ''uniform'' randomization, the discovered rules can unfortunately be exploited to find privacy breaches. We analyze the nature of privacy breaches and propose a class of randomization operators that are much more effective than uniform randomization in limiting the breaches. We derive formulae for an unbiased support estimator and its variance, which allow us to recover itemset supports from randomized datasets, and show how to incorporate these formulae into mining algorithms. Finally, we present experimental results that validate the algorithm by applying it on real datasets. r 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We discuss in detail the interpretation of the results discovered by the system including specific topic and author models, ranking of authors by topic and topics by author, significant trends in the computer science literature between 1990 and 2002, parsing of abstracts by topics and authors and detection of unusual papers by specific authors. An online query interface to the model is also discussed that allows interactive exploration of author-topic models for corpora such as CiteSeer.

Such transformations can reveal latent patterns and are very commonly used in datamining applications. However, when dealing with multidimensional time-series, which appear naturally in applications such as video-tracking, motion-capture etc, similar motion patterns can also be expressed at different orientations. It is therefore imperative to provide support for additional transformations, such as rotation. In this work, we transform the positional information of moving data, into a space that is translation, scale and rotation invariant. Our distance measure in the new space is able to detect elastic matches and can be efficiently lower bounded, thus being computationally tractable. The proposed methods are easy to implement, fast to compute and can have many applications for real world problems, in areas such as handwriting recognition and posture estimation in motion-capture data. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the technique, using real and synthetic handwriting data.

In the domain of gene expression data analysis, various researchers have recently emphasized the promising application of pattern discovery techniques like association rule mining or formal concept extraction from boolean matrices that encode gene properties. To take the most from these approaches, a needed step concerns gene property encoding (e.g., over-expression) and its need for the discretization of raw gene expression data. The impact of this preprocessing step on both the quantity and the relevancy of the extracted patterns is crucial. In this paper, we study the impact of discretization parameters by a sound comparison between the dendrograms, i.e., trees that are generated by a hierarchical clustering algorithm, computed from raw expression data and from the various derived boolean matrices. Thanks to a new similarity measure and practical validation over several gene expression data sets, we propose a method that supports the choice of a discretization technique and its parameters for each speci¯c data set.

The goal of the research described here is to develop a multistrategy classifier system that can be used for document categorization. The system automatically discovers classification patterns by applying several empirical learning methods to different representations for preclassified documents belonging to an imbalanced sample. The learners work in a parallel manner, where each learner carries out its own feature selection based on evolutionary techniques and then obtains a classification model. In classifying documents, the system combines the predictions of the learners by applying evolutionary techniques as well. The system relies on a modular, flexible architecture that makes no assumptions about the design of learners or the number of learners available and guarantees the independence of the thematic domain.

Two main dangers of working with parameter-laden algorithms are the following. First, incorrect settings may cause an algorithm to fail in finding the true patterns. Second, a perhaps more insidious problem is that the algorithm may report spurious patterns that do not really exist, or greatly overestimate the significance of the reported patterns. This is especially likely when the user fails to understand the role of parameters in the data mining process.Data mining algorithms should have as few parameters as possible, ideally none. A parameter-free algorithm would limit our ability to impose our prejudices, expectations, and presumptions on the problem at hand, and would let the data itself speak to us. In this work, we show that recent results in bioinformatics and computational theory hold great promise for a parameter-free data-mining paradigm. The results are motivated by observations in Kolmogorov complexity theory. However, as a practical matter, they can be implemented using any off-the-shelf compression algorithm with the addition of just a dozen or so lines of code. We will show that this approach is competitive or superior to the state-of-the-art approaches in anomaly/interestingness detection, classification, and clustering with empirical tests on time series/DNA/text/video datasets.

Given a set of comparable text collections, the task of comparative text mining is to discover any latent common themes across all collections as well as summarize the similarity and differences of these collections along each common theme. This general problem subsumes many interesting applications, including business intelligence and opinion summarization. We propose a generative probabilistic mixture model for comparative text mining. The model simultaneously performs cross-collection clustering and within-collection clustering, and can be applied to an arbitrary set of comparable text collections. The model can be estimated efficiently using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We evaluate the model on two different text data sets (i.e., a news article data set and a laptop review data set), and compare it with a baseline clustering method also based on a mixture model. Experiment results show that the model is quite effective in discovering the latent common themes across collections and performs significantly better than our baseline mixture model.

Keywords+Moving object+micro-cluster+clustering+algo- rithms	Due to the advances in positioning technologies, the real time information of moving objects becomes increasingly available, which has posed new challenges to the database research. As a long-standing technique to identify overall distribution patterns in data, clustering has achieved brilliant successes in analyzing static datasets. In this paper, we study the problem of clustering moving objects, which could catch interesting pattern changes during the motion process and provide better insight into the essence of the mobile data points. In order to catch the spatial-temporal regularities of moving objects and handle large amounts of data, micro-clustering [20] is employed. Efficient techniques are proposed to keep the moving micro-clusters geographically small. Important events such as the collisions among moving micro-clusters are also identified. In this way, high quality moving micro-clusters are dynamically maintained, which leads to fast and competitive clustering result at any given time instance. We validate our approaches with a through experimental evaluation, where orders of magnitude improvement on running time is observed over normal K-Means clustering method [14].

For example, people wake up at the same time and follow more or less the same route to their work everyday. The discovery of hidden periodic patterns in spatiotemporal data, apart from unveiling important information to the data analyst, can facilitate data management substantially. Based on this observation, we propose a framework that analyzes, manages, and queries object movements that follow such patterns. We define the spatiotemporal periodic pattern mining problem and propose an effective and fast mining algorithm for retrieving maximal periodic patterns. We also devise a novel, specialized index structure that can benefit from the discovered patterns to support more efficient execution of spatiotemporal queries. We evaluate our methods experimentally using datasets with object trajectories that exhibit periodicity.

Traditional kernel methods construct models based on a single positive semi-definite kernel with the type of kernel predefined and kernel parameters chosen according to cross-validation performance. Our approach creates models that are mixtures of a library of kernel models, and our algorithm automatically determines kernels to be used in the final model. The 1-norm and 2-norm regularization methods are employed to restrict the ensemble of kernel models. The proposed method produces sparser solutions, and thus significantly reduces the testing time. By extending the column generation (CG) optimization which existed for linear programs with 1-norm regularization to quadratic programs with 2-norm regularization, we are able to solve many learning formulations by leveraging various algorithms for constructing single kernel models. By giving different priorities to columns to be generated, we are able to scale CG boosting to large datasets. Experimental results on benchmark data are included to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Over this install base, TiVo currently has approximately 100 million ratings by users over approximately 30,000 distinct TV shows and movies. TiVo uses an item-item (show to show) form of collaborative filtering which obviates the need to keep any persistent memory of each user's viewing preferences at the TiVo server. Taking advantage of TiVo's client-server architecture has produced a novel collaborative filtering system in which the server does a minimum of work and most work is delegated to the numerous clients. Nevertheless, the server-side processing is also highly scalable and parallelizable. Although we have not performed formal empirical evaluations of its accuracy, internal studies have shown its recommendations to be useful even for multiple user households. TiVo's architecture also allows for throttling of the server so if more server-side resources become available, more correlations can be computed on the server allowing TiVo to make recommendations for niche audiences.

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) [11] has so far generated tens of millions of images of distant galaxies, of which only a tiny fraction have been morphologically classified. Morphological classification in this context is achieved by fitting a parametric model of galaxy shape to a galaxy image. This is a nonlinear regression problem, whose challenges are threefold, 1) blurring of the image caused by atmosphere and mirror imperfections, 2) large numbers of local minima, and 3) massive data sets.Our strategy is to use the eigenimages of the parametric model to form a new feature space, and then to map both target image and the model parameters into this feature space. In this low-dimensional space we search for the best image-to-parameter match. To search the space, we sample it by creating a database of many random parameter vectors (prototypes) and mapping them into the feature space. The search problem then becomes one of finding the best prototype match, so the fitting process a nearest-neighbor search.In addition to the savings realized by decomposing the original space into an eigenspace, we can use the fact that the model is a linear sum of functions to reduce the prototypes further: the only prototypes stored are the components of the model function. A modified form of nearest neighbor is used to search among them.Additional complications arise in the form of missing data and heteroscedasticity, both of which are addressed with weighted linear regression. Compared to existing techniques, speed-ups ach-ieved are between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude. This should enable the analysis of the entire SDSS dataset.

In the literature, a well-known dimension reduction algorithm is linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The common aspect of previously proposed LDA-based algorithms is the use of singular value decomposition (SVD). Due to the difficulty of designing an incremental solution for the eigenvalue problem on the product of scatter matrices in LDA, there has been little work on designing incremental LDA algorithms that can efficiently incorporate new data items as they become available. In this paper, we propose an LDA-based incremental dimension reduction algorithm, called IDR/QR, which applies QR decomposition rather than SVD. Unlike other LDA-based algorithms, this algorithm does not require the whole data matrix in main memory. This is desirable for large data sets. More importantly, with the insertion of new data items, the IDR/QR algorithm can constrain the computational cost by applying efficient QR-updating techniques. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the IDR/QR algorithm in terms of classification error rate on the reduced dimensional space. Our experiments on several real-world data sets reveal that the classification error rate achieved by the IDR/QR algorithm is very close to the best possible one achieved by other LDA-based algorithms. However, the IDR/QR algorithm has much less computational cost, especially when new data items are inserted dynamically.

The problem becomes particularly challenging due to the large number of features (genes) and small sample size. Traditional gene selection methods often select the top-ranked genes according to their individual discriminative power without handling the high degree of redundancy among the genes. Latest research shows that removing redundant genes among selected ones can achieve a better representation of the characteristics of the targeted phenotypes and lead to improved classification accuracy. Hence, we study in this paper the relationship between feature relevance and redundancy and propose an efficient method that can effectively remove redundant genes. The efficiency and effectiveness of our method in comparison with representative methods has been demonstrated through an empirical study using public microarray data sets.

One of the largest areas of bioinformatic and data mining research has been in the protein domain. These efforts have included protein structure prediction, folding pathway prediction, sequence alignment, ab initio simulation, structure alignment, substructure detection and many others. Substructure detection is generally defined as the mining of a molecule's 3D structure in order to find interesting/frequent domains. Sequence alignment involves determining the similarity of two (or more) protein molecules based on the how well their amino acid sequences “match.” There are potential pitfalls when trying solve both of these problems, however. In the case of substructure mining, focusing solely on structural information can lead to the discovery of biologically irrelevant substructures. With sequence alignment, the alignment results can vary greatly, depending on the substitution matrix used. In this paper we describe a method that combines the benefits of both substructure mining and sequence alignment in an attempt to determine the similarity between protein molecules. In the absence of biological information, our work will quickly and efficiently mine a protein molecule in order to determine frequent local structures. With the addition of biological sequence information, however, our algorithm provides a way to align proteins with similar local structures and sequence, yielding a global alignment between molecules. We present a novel structure mining/alignment algorithm as well as some additional work into a new clustering metric for amino acids based on several different physico-chemical properties. This metric is used with our alignment algorithm in order to provide a mechanism for globally aligning protein molecules.

Learning from imbalanced data sets, where the number of examples of one (majority) class is much higher than the others, presents an important challenge to the machine learning community. Traditional machine learning algorithms may be biased towards the majority class, thus producing poor predictive accuracy over the minority class. In this paper, we describe a new approach that combines boosting, an ensemble-based learning algorithm, with data generation to improve the predictive power of classifiers against imbalanced data sets consisting of two classes. In the DataBoost-IM method, hard examples from both the majority and minority classes are identified during execution of the boosting algorithm. Subsequently, the hard examples are used to separately generate synthetic examples for the majority and minority classes. The synthetic data are then added to the original training set, and the class distribution and the total weights of the different classes in the new training set are rebalanced. The DataBoost-IM method was evaluated, in terms of the F-measures, G-mean and overall accuracy, against seventeen highly and moderately imbalanced data sets using decision trees as base classifiers. Our results are promising and show that the DataBoost-IM method compares well in comparison with a base classifier, a standard benchmarking boosting algorithm and three advanced boosting-based algorithms for imbalanced data set. Results indicate that our approach does not sacrifice one class in favor of the other, but produces high predictions against both minority and majority classes.

Our segmentation system is robust, accurate, and efficient, and requires no additional manual effort. Thorough evaluation on real datasets demonstrates the robustness and accuracy of our system, with segmentation accuracy exceeding state of the art supervised approaches.

This is difficult because most high-performance named entity recognition systems operate by sequentially classifying words as to whether or not they participate in an entity name; however, the most useful similarity measures score entire candidate names. To correct this mismatch we formalize a semi-Markov extraction process, which is based on sequentially classifying segments of several adjacent words, rather than single words. In addition to allowing a natural way of coupling high-performance NER methods and high-performance similarity functions, this formalism also allows the direct use of other useful entity-level features, and provides a more natural formulation of the NER problem than sequential word classification. Experiments in multiple domains show that the new model can substantially improve extraction performance over previous methods for using external dictionaries in NER.

We report on an automated runtime anomaly detection method at the application layer of multi-node computer systems. Although several network management systems are available in the market, none of them have sufficient capabilities to detect faults in multi-tier Web-based systems with redundancy. We model a Web-based system as a weighted graph, where each node represents a “service” and each edge represents a dependency between services. Since the edge weights vary greatly over time, the problem we address is that of anomaly detection from a time sequence of graphs. In our method, we first extract a feature vector from the adjacency matrix that represents the activities of all of the services. The heart of our method is to use the principal eigenvector of the eigenclusters of the graph. Then we derive a probability distribution for an anomaly measure defined for a time-series of directional data derived from the graph sequence. Given a critical probability, the threshold value is adaptively updated using a novel online algorithm. We demonstrate that a fault in a Web application can be automatically detected and the faulty services are identified without using detailed knowledge of the behavior of the system.

We introduce a novel algorithm, loqr, which is designed to relax queries that are in the disjunctive normal form and contain a mixture of discrete and continuous attributes. loqr discovers the implicit relationships that exist among the various domain attributes and then uses this knowledge to relax the constraints from the failing query.In a first step, loqr uses a small, randomly-chosen subset of the target database to learn a set of decision rules that predict whether an attribute's value satisfies the constraints in the failing query; this query-driven operation is performed online for each failing query. In the second step, loqr uses nearest-neighbor techniques to find the learned rule that is the most similar to the failing query; then it uses the attributes' values from this rule to relax the failing query's constraints. Our experiments on six application domains show that loqr is both robust and fast: it successfully relaxes more than 95% of the failing queries, and it takes under a second for processing queries that consist of up to 20 attributes (larger queries of up to 93 attributes are processed in several seconds).

In this paper, we present an effective approach to address the pattern ordering problem by combining the rank information gathered from disparate sources. Although rank aggregation techniques have been developed for applications such as meta-search engines, they are not directly applicable to pattern ordering for two reasons. First, the techniques are mostly supervised, i.e., they require a sufficient amount of labeled data. Second, the objects to be ranked are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), an assumption that seldom holds in pattern ordering. The method proposed in this paper is an adaptation of the original Hedge algorithm, modified to work in an unsupervised learning setting. Techniques for addressing the i.i.d. violation in pattern ordering are also presented. Experimental results demonstrate that our unsupervised Hedge algorithm outperforms many alternative techniques such as those based on weighted average ranking and singular value decomposition.

We highlight the importance of this problem in domains such as bioinformatics, which exhibit an underlying richness and diversity of data descriptors (e.g., genes can be studied in a variety of ways). CARTwheels exploits the duality between class partitions and path partitions in an induced classification tree to model and mine redescriptions. It helps integrate multiple forms of characterizing datasets, situates the knowledge gained from one dataset in the context of others, and harnesses high-level abstractions for uncovering cryptic and subtle features of data.

Transformation of both the response variable and the predictors is commonly used in fitting regression models. However, these transformation methods do not always provide the maximum linear correlation between the response variable and the predictors, especially when there are non-linear relationships between predictors and the response such as the medical data set used in this study. A spline based transformation method is proposed that is second order smooth, continuous, and minimizes the mean squared error between the response and each predictor. Since the computation time for generating this spline is O(n), the processing time is reasonable with massive data sets. In contrast to cubic smoothing splines, the resulting transformation equations also display a high level of efficiency for scoring. Data used for predicting health outcomes contains an abundance of non-linear relationships between predictors and the outcomes requiring an algorithm for modeling them accurately. Thus, a transformation that fits an adaptive cubic spline to each of a set of variables is proposed. These curves are used as a set of transformation functions on the predictors. A case study of how the transformed variables can be fed into a simple linear regression model to predict risk outcomes is presented. The results show significant improvement over the performance of the original variables in both linear and nonlinear models.

The cost of a false positive, allowing a launch in spite of a fault, or a false negative, stopping a potentially successful launch, can be measured in the tens of millions of dollars, not including the cost in morale and other more intangible detriments. The Aerospace Corporation is responsible for providing engineering assessments critical to the go/no-go decision for every Department of Defense space vehicle. These assessments are made by constantly monitoring streaming telemetry data in the hours before launch. We will introduce VizTree, a novel time-series visualization tool to aid the Aerospace analysts who must make these engineering assessments. VizTree was developed at the University of California, Riverside and is unique in that the same tool is used for mining archival data and monitoring incoming live telemetry. The use of a single tool for both aspects of the task allows a natural and intuitive transfer of mined knowledge to the monitoring task. Our visualization approach works by transforming the time series into a symbolic representation, and encoding the data in a modified suffix tree in which the frequency and other properties of patterns are mapped onto colors and other visual properties. We demonstrate the utility of our system by comparing it with state-of-the-art batch algorithms on several real and synthetic datasets.

Most early detection systems produce a time series of p-values or some other statistic as their output. Typically, the decision to signal an alarm is based on a threshold or other simple algorithm such as CUSUM that accumulates detection information temporally.We formulate a POMDP model of underlying events and observations from a detector. We solve the model and show how it is used for single-output detectors. When dealing with spatio-temporal data, scan statistics are a popular method of building detectors. We describe the use of scan statistics in surveillance and how our POMDP model can be used to perform alarm signaling with them. We compare the results obtained by our method with simple thresholding and CUSUM on synthetic and semi-synthetic health data.

A number of feature selection metrics have been explored in text categorization, among which information gain (IG), chi-square (CHI), correlation coe cient (CC) and odds ratios (OR) are considered most e ective. CC and OR are one-sided metrics while IG and CHI are two-sided. Feature selection using one-sided metrics selects the features most indicative of membership only, while feature selection using two-sided metrics implicitly combines the features most indicative of membership (e.g. positive features) and nonmembership (e.g. negative features) by ignoring the signs of features. The former never consider the negative features, which are quite valuable, while the latter cannot ensure the optimal combination of the two kinds of features especially on imbalanced data. In this work, we investigate the usefulness of explicit control of that combination within a proposed feature selection framework. Using multinomial nave Bayes and regularized logistic regression as classi ers, our experiments show both great potential and actual merits of explicitly combining positive and negative features in a nearly optimal fashion according to the imbalanced data.

In this article we adapt a finite mixture mark-recapture model in order to estimate the number of active telephone lines in the USA. The idea is to use the calling patterns of lines that are observed on the long distance network to estimate the number of lines that do not appear on the network. We present a Bayesian approach and use Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to obtain inference from the posterior distributions of the model parameters. At the state level, our results are in fairly good agreement with recent published reports on line counts. For lines that are easily classified as business or residence, the estimates have low variance. When the classification is unknown, the variability increases considerably. Results are insensitive to changes in the prior distributions. We discuss the significant computational and data mining challenges caused by the scale of the data, approximately 350 million call-detail records per day observed over a number of weeks.

Keywords Change patterns+parallel coordinate visualization+rules	Analyzing data to find trends, correlations, and stable patterns is an important task in many industrial applications. This paper proposes a new technique based on parallel coordinate visualization. Previous work on parallel coordinate methods has shown that they are effective only when variables that are correlated and/or show similar patterns are displayed adjacently. Although current parallel coordinate tools allow the user to manually rearrange the order of variables, this process is very time-consuming when the number of variables is large. Automated assistance is required. This paper introduces an edit-distance based technique to rearrange variables so that interesting change patterns can be easily detected visually. The Visual Miner (V-Miner) software includes both automated methods for visualizing common patterns and a query tool that enables the user to describe specific target patterns to be mined or displayed by the system. In addition, the system can filter data according to rules sets imported from other data mining tools. This feature was found very helpful in practice, because it enables decision makers to visually identify interesting rules and data segments for further analysis or data mining. This paper begins with an introduction to the proposed techniques and the V-Miner system. Next, a case study illustrates how V-Miner has been used at Motorola to guide product design and test decisions.

A common approach to interpretation is to plot the dependence of a learned function on one or two predictors. We present a method that seeks not to display the behavior of a function, but to evaluate the importance of non-additive interactions within any set of variables. Should the function be close to a sum of low dimensional components, these components can be viewed and even modeled parametrically. Alternatively, the work here provides an indication of where intrinsically high-dimensional behavior takes place.The calculations used in this paper correspond closely with the functional ANOVA decomposition; a well-developed construction in Statistics. In particular, the proposed score of interaction importance measures the loss associated with the projection of the prediction function onto a space of additive models. The algorithm runs in linear time and we present displays of the output as a graphical model of the function for interpretation purposes.

In many cases, users would like to search for information of a certain 'object', rather than a web page containing the query terms. To facilitate web object searching and organizing, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to web object indexing, by discovering its inherent structure information with existed domain knowledge. In our approach, first, Layered LSI spaces are built for a better representation of the hierarchically structured domain knowledge, in order to emphasize the specific semantics and term space in each layer of the domain knowledge. Meanwhile, the web object representation is constructed by hyperlink analysis, and further pruned to remove the noises. Then an optimal matching between the web object and the domain knowledge is performed, in order to pick out the structure attributes of the web object from the knowledge. Finally, the obtained structure attributes are used to re-organize and index the web objects. Our approach also indicates a new promising way to use trust-worthy Deep Web knowledge to help organize dispersive information of Surface Web.

These vulnerabilities mostly emanate from the open nature of such systems and their reliance on user-specified judgments for building profiles. Attackers can easily introduce biased data in an attempt to force the system to “adapt” in a manner advantageous to them. Our research in secure personalization is examining a range of attack models, from the simple to the complex, and a variety of recommendation techniques. In this chapter, we explore an attack model that focuses on a subset of users with similar tastes and show that such an attack can be highly successful against both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering. We also introduce a detection model that can significantly decrease the impact of this attack.

However, most of filter methods reported in the literature are developed for continuous feature selection. In this paper, we proposed a filter method for mixed data with both continuous and nominal features. The new algorithm includes a novel criterion for mixed feature evaluation, and a novel search algorithm for mixed feature subset generation. The proposed method is tested using a few benchmark real-world problems.

The migration has now proceeded to the point that topics reflecting certain individual products are sufficiently popular to allow targeted online tracking of the ebb and flow of chatter around these topics. Based on an analysis of around half a million sales rank values for 2,340 books over a period of four months, and correlating postings in blogs, media, and web pages, we are able to draw several interesting conclusions.First, carefully hand-crafted queries produce matching postings whose volume predicts sales ranks. Second, these queries can be automatically generated in many cases. And third, even though sales rank motion might be difficult to predict in general, algorithmic predictors can use online postings to successfully predict spikes in sales rank.

They are used to address a wide range of important issues including network failure symptom detection and event correlation discovery. Syslogs are intrinsically dynamic in the sense that they form a time series and that their behavior may change over time. This paper proposes a new methodology of dynamic syslog mining in order to detect failure symptoms with higher confidence and to discover sequential alarm patterns among computer devices. The key ideas of dynamic syslog mining are 1) to represent syslog behavior using a mixture of Hidden Markov Models, 2) to adaptively learn the model using an on-line discounting learning algorithm in combination with dynamic selection of the optimal number of mixture components, and 3) to give anomaly scores using universal test statistics with a dynamically optimized threshold. Using real syslog data we demonstrate the validity of our methodology in the scenarios of failure symptom detection, emerging pattern identification, and correlation discovery.

In this paper, we will explore and survey some of our recent methods for change detection. In particular, we will study methods for change detection which use clustering in order to provide a concise understanding of the underlying trends.

We also discuss the extension of this method to text and categorical data sets as well community detection in graph data streams.

To meet this objective, we describe a procedure that first fits clinical variables measured over time to a disease progression model. The resulting parameter estimates are then used as the basis for a stepwise clustering procedure to stratify patients into groups with distinct survival characteristics. As a practical illustration, we apply this procedure to survival prediction, using a liver transplant database from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).

Gaussian mixture model (GMM) assumes that data points are generated from a set of Gaussian models with the same set of mixture weights. A natural extension of GMM is the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) model, which assigns different mixture weights for each data point. Thus, PLSA is more flexible than the GMM method. However, as a tradeoff, PLSA usually suffers from the overfitting problem. In this paper, we propose a regularized probabilistic latent semantic analysis model (RPLSA), which can properly adjust the amount of model flexibility so that not only the training data can be fit well but also the model is robust to avoid the overfitting problem. We conduct empirical study for the application of speaker identification to show the effectiveness of the new model. The experiment results on the NIST speaker recognition dataset indicate that the RPLSA model outperforms both the GMM and PLSA models substantially. The principle of RPLSA of appropriately adjusting model flexibility can be naturally extended to other applications and other types of mixture models.

Within the fields of user profiling and Web personalization several popular content filtering techniques have been developed. In this chapter we present one of such techniques – collaborative filtering. Apart from giving an overview of collaborative filtering approaches, we present the experimental results of confronting the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm with Support Vector Machine (SVM) in the collaborative filtering framework using datasets with different properties. While the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is usually used for collaborative filtering tasks, Support Vector Machine is considered a state-of-the-art classification algorithm. Since collaborative filtering can also be interpreted as a classification/regression task, virtually any supervised learning algorithm (such as SVM) can also be applied. Experiments were performed on two standard, publicly available datasets and, on the other hand, on a real-life corporate dataset that does not fit the profile of ideal data for collaborative filtering. We conclude that the quality of collaborative filtering recommendations is highly dependent on the sparsity of available data. Furthermore, we show that kNN is dominant on datasets with relatively low sparsity while SVM-based approaches may perform better on highly sparse data.

In particular, Kandola et al.'s Neumann kernels are shown to subsume not only the co-citation and bibliographic coupling relatedness but also Kleinberg's HITS importance. These popular measures of relatedness and importance correspond to the Neumann kernels at the extremes of their parameter range, and hence these kernels can be interpreted as defining a spectrum of link analysis measures intermediate between co-citation/bibliographic coupling and HITS. We also show that the kernels based on the graph Laplacian, including the regularized Laplacian and diffusion kernels, provide relatedness measures that overcome some limitations of co-citation relatedness. The property of these kernel-based link analysis measures is examined with a network of bibliographic citations. Practical issues in applying these methods to real data are discussed, and possible solutions are proposed.

Unlike traditional supervised manifold learning algorithm, the proposed ANAM algorithm has several advantages: 1) it implicitly embodies discriminant information because the suboptimal parameters of ANAM are determined based on error rate of the validation set. 2) it avoids the curse of dimensionality without loss accuracy because recognition is completed in the original space. Experiments on character and digit databases show that the advantages of the proposed ANAM algorithm.

To address this problem, we present a Divisive-Agglomerative clustering method to find hierarchical topic from Web news stream. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is the ability to identify meaningful news topics while reducing the amount of computations by maintaining cluster structure incrementally. Our streaming news clustering algorithm also works by leveraging off the nearest neighbors of the incoming streaming news datasets and has ability of identifying the different shapes and different densities of clusters. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed clustering algorithm produces high-quality topic discovery.

Keywords Text Mining+Data Cleaning+Email Processing+Statistical Learning	Addressed in this paper is the issue of 'email data cleaning' for text mining. Many text mining applications need take emails as input. Email data is usually noisy and thus it is necessary to clean it before mining. Several products offer email cleaning features, however, the types of noises that can be eliminated are restricted. Despite the importance of the problem, email cleaning has received little attention in the research community. A thorough and systematic investigation on the issue is thus needed. In this paper, email cleaning is formalized as a problem of non-text filtering and text normalization. In this way, email cleaning becomes independent from any specific text mining processing. A cascaded approach is proposed, which cleans up an email in four passes including non-text filtering, paragraph normalization, sentence normalization, and word normalization. As far as we know, non-text filtering and paragraph normalization have not been investigated previously. Methods for performing the tasks on the basis of Support Vector Machines (SVM) have also been proposed in this paper. Features in the models have been defined. Experimental results indicate that the proposed SVM based methods can significantly outperform the baseline methods for email cleaning. The proposed method has been applied to term extraction, a typical text mining processing. Experimental results show that the accuracy of term extraction can be significantly improved by using the data cleaning method.

In contrast, we consider the setting in which the background knowledge is instead about an undesired clustering. Such knowledge may be obtained from an existing classification or precedent algorithm. The problem is then to find a novel, ""orthogonal"" clustering in the data. We present a general algorithmic framework which makes use of cluster ensemble methods to solve this problem. One key advantage of this approach is that it takes a base clustering method which is used as a black box, allowing the practitioner to select the most appropriate clustering method for the domain. We present experimental results on synthetic and text data which establish the competitiveness of this framework."

We propose a method to (re)rank the results from a search engine using a learned user profile, called a user interest hierarchy (UIH), from web pages that are of interest to the user. The user’s interest in web pages will be determined implicitly, without directly asking the user. Experimental results indicate that our personalized ranking methods, when used with a popular search engine, can yield more potentially interesting web pages for individual users.

Typically, these applications concern only the model accuracy at a relatively small pull or contact/intervention rate of the whole customer base, which is predetermined by a budget constraint for the project, e.g., how many customers can be contacted every month. In this paper, we address the important problem of enhancing the lift (true positive rate) at a specified pull rate. We propose two distinct algorithms, which are applicable to different scenarios. In particular, when the binary class label of the training set is extracted from a continuous variable, we can optimize a training objective which takes into account the specified pull rate rather than the class prior, based on the often ignored continuous variable. In those cases where only the binary class label is available during training, we propose a constrained optimization algorithm to maximize the true positive rate related to a specific decision threshold at which the specified pull rate is achieved. We applied both algorithms to our projects of predicting defection (decline in account value) of mutual fund accounts for two major U.S. mutual fund companies and achieved substantial enhancement of the lift at the specified pull rate.

The technique uses pipelined processing phases including sub-abstraction of sessionized Web clickstreams, clustering of the abstracted Web sessions, concept-based abstraction of the clustered sessions, and SUP generation. Using this technique, valuable customer behavior information can be extracted by Web site practitioners. Experiments conducted using Web log data provided by J.C.Penney demonstrate that SUPs of different types of customers are distinguishable and interpretable. This technique is particularly suited for analysis of dynamic websites.

In such rare class data domains, the cost of missing a rare-class instance is much higher than that of other classes. However, the high cost for manual labeling of instances, the high rate at which data is collected as well as real-time response constraints do not always allow one to determine the actual classes for the collected unlabeled datasets. In our previous work [9], this problem of missed false negatives was explained in context of two different domains -- ""network intrusion detection"" and ""business opportunity classification"". In such cases, an estimate for the number of such missed high-cost, rare instances will aid in the evaluation of the performance of the modeling technique (e.g. classification) used. A capture-recapture method was used for estimating false negatives, using two or more learning methods (i.e. classifiers). This paper focuses on the dependence between the class labels assigned by such learners. We define the conditional independence for classifiers given a class label and show its relation to the conditional independence of the features sets (used by the classifiers) given a class label. The later is a computationally expensive problem and hence, a heuristic algorithm is proposed for obtaining conditionally independent (or less dependent) feature sets for the classifiers. Initial results of this algorithm on synthetic datasets are promising and further research is being pursued."

Our framework decouples data privacy issues from knowledge integration issues by requiring the individual sites to share only privacy-safe probabilistic models of the local data, which are then integrated to obtain a global probabilistic model based on the union of the features available at all the sites. We provide a mathematical formulation of the model integration problem using the maximum likelihood and maximum entropy principles and describe iterative algorithms that are guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution. For certain commonly occurring special cases involving hierarchically ordered feature sets or conditional independence, we obtain closed form solutions and use these to propose an efficient alternative scheme by recursive decomposition of the model integration problem. To address interpretability concerns, we also present a modified formulation where the global model is assumed to belong to a specified parametric family. Finally, to highlight the generality of our framework, we provide empirical results for various learning tasks such as clustering and classification on different kinds of datasets consisting of continuous vector, categorical and directional attributes. The results show that high quality global models can be obtained without much loss of privacy.

As an essential task toward integrating these massive ""deep Web"" sources, large scale schema matching (i.e., discovering semantic correspondences of attributes across many query interfaces) has been actively studied recently. In particular, many works have emerged to address this problem by ""holistically"" matching many schemas at the same time and thus pursuing ""mining"" approaches in nature. However, while holistic schema matching has built its promise upon the large quantity of input schemas, it also suffers the robustness problem caused by noisy data quality. Such noises often inevitably arise in the automatic extraction of schema data, which is mandatory in large scale integration. For holistic matching to be viable, it is thus essential to make it robust against noisy schemas. To tackle this challenge, we propose a data-ensemble framework with sampling and voting techniques, which is inspired by bagging predictors. Specifically, our approach creates an ensemble of matchers, by randomizing input schema data into many independently downsampled trials, executing the same matcher on each trial and then aggregating their ranked results by taking majority voting. As a principled basis, we provide analytic justification of the effectiveness of this data-ensemble framework. Further, empirically, our experiments on real Web data show that the ""ensemblization"" indeed significantly boosts the matching accuracy under noisy schema input, and thus maintains the desired robustness of a holistic matcher."

While an extensive research has been carried out for discovering positive patterns, little has been offered for discovering patterns with negation. An amount of frequent patterns with negation is usually huge and exceeds the number of frequent positive patterns by orders of magnitude. The problem can be significantly alleviated by applying the generalized disjunction-free literal sets representation, which is a concise lossless representation of all frequent patterns, both with and without negation. In this paper, we offer new efficient algorithm GDFLR-SO-Apriori for discovering this representation and evaluate it against the GDFLR-Apriori algorithm.

Keywords+data mining+clustering+relational databases	Clustering is an essential data mining task with numerous applications. However, data in most real-life applications are high-dimensional in nature, and the related information often spreads across multiple relations. To ensure effective and efficient high-dimensional, cross-relational clustering, we propose a new approach, called CrossClus, which performs cross-relational clustering with user's guidance. We believe that user's guidance, even likely in very simple forms, could be essential for effective high-dimensional clustering since a user knows well the application requirements and data semantics. CrossClus is carried out as follows: A user specifies a clustering task and selects one or a small set of features pertinent to the task. CrossClus extracts the set of highly relevant features in multiple relations connected via linkages defined in the database schema, evaluates their effectiveness based on user's guidance, and identifies interesting clusters that fit user's needs. This method takes care of both quality in feature extraction and efficiency in clustering. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of this approach.

It is then illustrated with an example of discovering knowledge from competitors' websites. The knowledge to be discovered is in the form of association rules. A user's background knowledge is represented as a concept hierarchy developed from documents on his/her own website. The concept hierarchy captures the semantic usage of words and relationships among words in background documents. Association rules are identified among the noun phrases extracted from documents on competitors' websites. The interestingness measure, i.e. novelty, which measures the semantic distance between the antecedent and the consequent of a rule in the background knowledge, is computed from the co-occurrence frequency of words and the connection lengths among words in the concept hierarchy. A user evaluation of the novelty of discovered rules demonstrates that the correlation between the algorithm and the human judges is comparable to that between human judges.

The traditional cosine similarity suffers from its inability to represent the semantic relationship of terms. This paper explores the kernel-based similarity measure by using term clustering. An affinity matrix of terms is constructed via the co-occurrence of the terms in both unsupervised and supervised ways. Normalized cut is employed to do the clustering to cut off the noisy edges. Diffusion kernel is adopted to measure the kernel-like similarity of the terms in the same cluster. Experiments demonstrate our methods can give satisfactory results, even when the training set is small.

As part of content management, such collections are periodically merged and groomed. In the process, it becomes important to identify and weed out support documents that are largely duplicates of newer versions. Doing so improves the quality of the collection, eliminates chaff from search results, and improves customer satisfaction.The technical challenge is that through workflow and human processes, the knowledge of which documents are related is often lost. We required a method that could identify similar documents based on their content alone, without relying on metadata, which may be corrupt or missing.We present an approach for finding similar files that scales up to large document repositories. It is based on chunking the byte stream to find unique signatures that may be shared in multiple files. An analysis of the file-chunk graph yields clusters of related files. An optional bipartite graph partitioning algorithm can be applied to greatly increase scalability.

Preserving the parameter dependence of models in the pattern mining context opens up several applications. Within association rule mining (ARM), the choice of parameters can be studied with more flexibly then in traditional model building. Studying support, confidence, and other rule metrics as a function of model parameters allows conclusions on assumptions underlying the models. We present efficient techniques to handle multiple model output data sets at little more than the cost of one. We integrate output from hidden Markov models into the association rule mining framework, demonstrating the potential for frequent pattern mining in the field of scientific modeling and experimentation.

Commonly, the distances between these uncertain object descriptions are expressed by one numerical distance value. Based on such single-valued distance functions standard data mining algorithms can work without any changes. In this paper, we propose to express the similarity between two fuzzy objects by distance probability functions. These fuzzy distance functions assign a probability value to each possible distance value. By integrating these fuzzy distance functions directly into data mining algorithms, the full information provided by these functions is exploited. In order to demonstrate the benefits of this general approach, we enhance the density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN so that it can work directly on these fuzzy distance functions. In a detailed experimental evaluation based on artificial and real-world data sets, we show the characteristics and benefits of our new approach.

Keywords Data mining+manufacturing+chemical industry	In this paper we describe the experience of introducing data mining to a large chemical manufacturing company. The multi-national nature of doing business with multiple business units, presents a unique opportunity for the deployment of data mining. While each business unit has its own objectives and challenges, which may be at odds with those of other units, they also share many common interests and resources. In this environment, data mining can be used to identify potential value-creating opportunities, through large site integration of multiple assets and synergies from the use of common assets, such as site-wide manufacturing facilities, and world-wide supply-chain, purchasing and other shared services. However, issues arise, on one hand from overly complex systems, and on the other hand, from the danger of reaching sub-optimal solutions, if a big enough picture is not considered when executing projects. The company-wide initiative and use of Six Sigma at all levels of the company provided a fertile ground for making the case for data mining and facilitating its acceptance. The Six Sigma mindset of measuring the performance of processes and analyzing data promotes data-based decision making, therefore making data mining a natural extension of this methodology. We will describe the approach for launching a data mining capability within this framework, the strategy for securing upper management support, drawing from internal modeling, statistical, and other communities, and from external consultants and universities. Lessons learned from industrial case studies, enterprise-wide tool evaluation and peer benchmarking will be discussed.

The Email Mining Toolkit, EMT, has been designed to provide a wide range of analyses for arbitrary email sources. Depending upon the task, one can usually achieve very high accuracy, but with some amount of false positive tradeoff. Generally false positives are prohibitively expensive in the real world. In the case of spam detection, for example, even if one email is misclassified, this may be unacceptable if it is a very important email. Much work has been done to improve specific algorithms for the task of detecting unwanted messages, but less work has been report on leveraging multiple algorithms and correlating models in this particular domain of email analysis.EMT has been updated with new correlation functions allowing the analyst to integrate a number of EMT's user behavior models available in the core technology. We present results of combining classifier outputs for improving both accuracy and reducing false positives for the problem of spam detection. We apply these methods to a very large email data set and show results of different combination methods on these corpora. We introduce a new method to compare multiple and combined classifiers, and show how it differs from past work. The method analyzes the relative gain and maximum possible accuracy that can be achieved for certain combinations of classifiers to automatically choose the best combination.

This limits the utility of a classifier to a range in which such constraints can be met. Naive Bayes, which has proven to be very useful in text mining applications due to high scalability, can be particularly affected. Although its 0/1 loss tends to be small, its misclassifications are often made with apparently high confidence. Aside from efforts to better calibrate Naive Bayes scores, it has been shown that its accuracy depends on document sparsity and feature selection can lead to marked improvement in classification performance. Traditionally, sparsity is controlled globally, and the result for any particular document may vary. In this work we examine the merits of local sparsity control for Naive Bayes in the context of highly asymmetric misclassification costs. In experiments with three benchmark document collections we demonstrate clear advantages of document-level feature selection. In the extreme cost setting, multinomial Naive Bayes with local sparsity control is able to outperform even some of the recently proposed effective improvements to the Naive Bayes classifier. There are also indications that local feature selection may be preferable in different cost settings.

Data mining can extract valuable knowledge from this data, and organizations have realized that they can often obtain better results by pooling their data together. However, the collected data may contain sensitive or private information about the organizations or their customers, and privacy concerns are exacerbated if data is shared between multiple organizations.Distributed data mining is concerned with the computation of models from data that is distributed among multiple participants. Privacy-preserving distributed data mining seeks to allow for the cooperative computation of such models without the cooperating parties revealing any of their individual data items. Our paper makes two contributions in privacy-preserving data mining. First, we introduce the concept of arbitrarily partitioned data, which is a generalization of both horizontally and vertically partitioned data. Second, we provide an efficient privacy-preserving protocol for k-means clustering in the setting of arbitrarily partitioned data.

When the space of potential features is large, SFS offers many advantages over traditional feature selection methods, which assume that all features are known in advance. Features can be generated dynamically, focusing the search for new features on promising subspaces, and overfitting can be controlled by dynamically adjusting the threshold for adding features to the model. We describe α-investing, an adaptive complexity penalty method for SFS which dynamically adjusts the threshold on the error reduction required for adding a new feature. α-investing gives false discovery rate-style guarantees against overfitting. It differs from standard penalty methods such as AIC, BIC or RIC, which always drastically over- or under-fit in the limit of infinite numbers of non-predictive features. Empirical results show that SFS is competitive with much more compute-intensive feature selection methods such as stepwise regression, and allows feature selection on problems with over a million potential features.

By applying transition probability matrix this paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving classification mining algorithm which suits all data types, arbitrary probability distribution of original data, and perturbing all attributes (including label attribute). Experimental results demonstrate that decision tree built using this algorithm on perturbed data has comparable classifying accuracy to decision tree built using un-privacy-preserving algorithm on original data.

In applications such as paleontology and medical genetics the 0-1 data has an underlying unknown order (the ages of the fossil sites, the locations of markers in the genome). The order might be total or partial: for example, two sites in di erent parts of the globe might be ecologically incomparable, or the ordering of certain markers might be di erent in di erent subgroups of the data. We consider the following problem. Given a table over a set of 0-1 variables, nd a partial order for the rows minimizing a score function and being as speci c as possible. The score function can be, e.g., the number of changes from 1 to 0 in a column (for paleontology) or the likelihood of the marker sequence (for genomic data). Our solution for this task rst constructs small totally ordered fragments of the partial order, then nds good orientations for the fragments, and nally uses a simple and e cient heuristic method for nding a partial order that corresponds well with the collection of fragments. We describe the method, discuss its properties, and give empirical results on paleontological data demonstrating the usefulness of the method. In the application the use of the method highlighted some previously unknown properties of the data and pointed out probable errors in the data.

Fortunately, a wide spectrum of applications exhibit strong dependencies between data samples. For example, the readings of nearby sensors are generally correlated, and proteins interact with each other when performing crucial functions. Therefore, dependencies among data can be successfully exploited to remedy the problems mentioned above. In this paper, we propose a unified approach to improving mining quality using Markov networks as the data model to exploit local dependencies. Belief propagation is used to efficiently compute the marginal or maximum posterior probabilities, so as to clean the data, to infer missing values, or to improve the mining results from a model that ignores these dependencies. To illustrate the benefits and great generality of the technique, we present its application to three challenging problems: (i) cost-efficient sensor probing, (ii) enhancing protein function predictions, and (iii) sequence data denoising.

Various monitoring methods provide a large amount of data about system's behavior. Analyzing this data with advanced statistical methods holds the promise of not only detecting the errors faster, but also detecting errors which are difficult to catch with current monitoring tools. Two challenges to building such detection tools are: the high dimensionality of observation data, which makes the models expensive to apply, and frequent system changes, which make the models expensive to update. In this paper, we present algorithms to reduce the dimensionality of data in a way that makes it easy to adapt to system changes. We decompose the observation data into signal and noise subspaces. Two statistics, the Hotelling T2 score and squared prediction error (SPE) are calculated to represent the data characteristics in signal and noise subspaces respectively. Instead of tracking the original data, we use a sequentially discounting expectation maximization (SDEM) algorithm to learn the distribution of the two extracted statistics. A failure event can then be detected based on the abnormal change of the distribution. Applying our technique to component interaction data in a simple e-commerce application shows better accuracy than building independent profiles for each component. Additionally, experiments on synthetic data show that the detection accuracy is high even for changing systems.

In particular, individuals have become increasingly unwilling to share their data, frequently resulting in individuals either refusing to share their data or providing incorrect data. In turn, such problems in data collection can affect the success of data mining, which relies on sufficient amounts of accurate data in order to produce meaningful results. Random perturbation and randomized response techniques can provide some level of privacy in data collection, but they have an associated cost in accuracy. Cryptographic privacy-preserving data mining methods provide good privacy and accuracy properties. However, in order to be efficient, those solutions must be tailored to specific mining tasks, thereby losing generality.In this paper, we propose efficient cryptographic techniques for online data collection in which data from a large number of respondents is collected anonymously, without the help of a trusted third party. That is, our solution allows the miner to collect the original data from each respondent, but in such a way that the miner cannot link a respondent's data to the respondent. An advantage of such a solution is that, because it does not change the actual data, its success does not depend on the underlying data mining problem. We provide proofs of the correctness and privacy of our solution, as well as experimental data that demonstrates its efficiency. We also extend our solution to tolerate certain kinds of malicious behavior of the participants.

While several modern approaches based on qualitative reasoning, expert systems, and probabilistic reasoning have been developed recently for this purpose, any of them has a common difficulty in obtaining accurate and complete a priori knowledge on the space systems from human experts. A reasonable alternative to this conventional anomaly detection method is to reuse a vast amount of telemetry data which is multi-dimensional time-series continuously produced from a number of system components in the spacecraft.This paper proposes a novel ""knowledge-free"" anomaly detection method for spacecraft based on Kernel Feature Space and directional distribution, which constructs a system behavior model from the past normal telemetry data from a set of telemetry data in normal operation and monitors the current system status by checking incoming data with the model.In this method, we regard anomaly phenomena as unexpected changes of causal associations in the spacecraft system, and hypothesize that the significant causal associations inside the system will appear in the form of principal component directions in a high-dimensional non-linear feature space which is constructed by a kernel function and a set of data.We have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed anomaly detection method by applying it to the telemetry data obtained from a simulator of an orbital transfer vehicle designed to make a rendezvous maneuver with the International Space Station."

The method builds a query language model and document language models respectively for the query and the documents. We rank the documents according to the relative entropies of the estimated document language models with respect to the estimated query language model. The feedback documents are used to estimate a query model by the approach that we assume that the feedback documents are generated by a combined model in which one component is the feedback document language model and the other is the collection language model. Experimental results show that the method is effective for feedback documents and performs better than the basic language modeling approach. The results also indicate that the performance of the method is sensitive to both the smoothing parameters and the interpolation coefficients used to estimate the values of the language models.

Self-training is a semi-supervised learning algorithm in which a learner keeps on labeling unlabeled examples and retraining itself on an enlarged labeled training set. Since the self-training process may erroneously label some unlabeled examples, sometimes the learned hypothesis does not perform well. In this paper, a new algorithm named Setred is proposed, which utilizes a speci¯c data editing method to identify and remove the mislabeled examples from the self-labeled data. In detail, in each iteration of the self-training process, the local cut edge weight statistic is used to help estimate whether a newly labeled example is reliable or not, and only the reliable self-labeled examples are used to enlarge the labeled training set. Experiments show that the introduction of data editing is bene¯cial, and the learned hypotheses of Setred outperform those learned by the standard self-training algorithm.

The challenges presented by this prediction problem are significant. Firstly, the diversity of products used by corporate telecommunications customers is huge. This, coupled with low product take-up rates, makes this a problem of learning from a very high dimensional feature space with very few minority examples. Further, it is important to give priority specifically to the identification of those new customers who are of high value. These challenges are overcome by introducing a number of modifications to standard data pre-processing and machine learning algorithms, the most important of which are time-interleaving of data and value weighting. Time interleaving is the concatenation of examples from multiple time periods, thus increasing the number of training examples, and hence the number of minority examples. Value weighting assigns importance to minority examples in proportion to the dollar value of take-up, thus biasing the system to identify high value customers. These modifications create a novel algorithm that makes the prediction system practical and usable.Comparison with other techniques designed for similar problems shows that the expected average improvement in ranking accuracy achieved using these modifications is 3.7%. TIPPPS has been in operation for several months and has been successful in identifying many upsell opportunities that were not identified by using the previous manual system.

Kernel boosted latent features (KBLF) is a variant of KPLS for any differentiable convex loss functions. It provides a more flexible framework for various predictive modeling tasks such as classification with logistic loss and robust regression with L1 norm loss, etc. However, KPLS and KBLF solutions are dense and thus not suitable for large-scale computations. Sparsification of KPLS solutions has been studied for dual and primal forms. For dual sparsity, it requires solving a nonlinear optimization problem at every iteration step and its computational burden limits its applicability to general regression tasks.In this paper, we propose simple heuristics to approximate sparse solutions for KPLS and the framework is also applied for sparsifying KBLF solutions. The algorithm provides an interesting ""path"" from a maximum residual criterion based algorithm with orthogonality conditions to the dense KPLS/KBLF. With the orthogonality, it differentiates itself from many existing forward selection-type algorithms. The computational advantage is illustrated by benchmark datasets and comparison to SVM is done."

Traditional association rules mining cannot meet the demands arising from some real applications. By considering the different values of individual items as utilities, utility mining focuses on identifying the itemsets with high utilities. In this paper, we present a Two-Phase algorithm to efficiently prune down the number of candidates and precisely obtain the complete set of high utility itemsets. It performs very efficiently in terms of speed and memory cost both on synthetic and real databases, even on large databases that are difficult for existing algorithms to handle.

However, except checking the anchor text of links and the content of pages, there has been few of research addressing other possibilities to improve topic relevance while collecting the base set. In this paper, we propose a potential hub and authority first (PHA-first) approach utilizing the concept of hub and authority to filter web pages. We investigate the satisfaction of dozens of users about the pages recommended by our method and HITS on different topics. The results indicate that our method is superior to HITS in most cases. In addition, we also evaluate the recall and precision measures of our method. The results show that our method is with relative high precision and low recall for all topics.

The problem domain of voxelwise magnetic-resonance image analysis often involves millions of variables but only dozens of samples. Judicious variable selection may render classification tractable, avoid over-fitting, and improve classifier performance. BNCIT embeds the variable-selection process within the classifier-training process, which makes this algorithm scalable. BNCIT is based on a Bayesian-network model with inverse-tree structure, i.e., the class variable C is a leaf node, and predictive variables are parents of C; thus, the classifier-training process returns a parent set for C, which is a subset of the Markov blanket of C. BNCIT uses voxels in the parent set, and voxels that are probabilistically equivalent to them, as variables for classification of new image data. Since the data set has a limited number of samples, we use the jackknife method to determine whether the classifier generated by BNCIT is a statistical artifact. In order to enhance stability and improve classification accuracy, we model the state of the probabilistically equivalent voxels with a latent variable. We employ an efficient method for determining states of hidden variables, thus reducing dramatically the computational cost of model generation. Experimental results confirm the accuracy and efficiency of BNCIT.

At each iteration observations are re-weighted using the gradient of the underlying loss function. We present an approach of weight decay for observation weights which is equivalent to ""robustifying"" the underlying loss function. At the extreme end of decay this approach converges to Bagging, which can be viewed as boosting with a linear underlying loss function. We illustrate the practical usefulness of weight decay for improving prediction performance and present an equivalence between one form of weight decay and ""Huberizing"" --- a statistical method for making loss functions more robust."

During training, the fuzzy c-means algorithm is initially used to form the clusters in the cluster layer; then the evolutionary algorithm is employed to optimize those clusters and their parameters. During testing, the class whose cluster node returns the maximum output value is the result of the prediction. This proposed model has been benchmarked against the standard backpropagation neural network, the fuzzy ARTMAP, C4.5, and CART. The results on six benchmark problems are very encouraging.

The goal has been to increase sales by tapping into the user’s interests by utilizing information from various data sources to make relevant recommendations. Education, government, and policy websites face parallel challenges, except the product is information and their users may not be aware of what is relevant and what isn’t. Given a large, knowledge-dense website and a nonexpert user searching for information, making relevant recommendations becomes a significant challenge. This paper addresses the problem of providing recommendations to non-experts, helping them understand what they need to know, as opposed to what is popular among other users. The approach is usersensitive in that it adopts a ‘model of learning’ whereby the user’s context is dynamically interpreted as they browse and then leveraging that information to improve our recommendations.

SVMs (Support Vector Machines) - a classification and regression methodology - have also shown excellent performance in learning ranking functions. They effectively learn ranking functions of high generalization based on the ""large-margin"" principle and also systematically support nonlinear ranking by the ""kernel trick"". In this paper, we propose an SVM selective sampling technique for learning ranking functions. SVM selective sampling (or active learning with SVM) has been studied in the context of classification. Such techniques reduce the labeling effort in learning classification functions by selecting only the most informative samples to be labeled. However, they are not extendable to learning ranking functions, as the labeled data in ranking is relative ordering, or partial orders of data. Our proposed sampling technique effectively learns an accurate SVM ranking function with fewer partial orders. We apply our sampling technique to the data retrieval application, which enables fuzzy search on relational databases by interacting with users for learning their preferences. Experimental results show a significant reduction of the labeling effort in inducing accurate ranking functions."

We define Key semantics as characteristic sub-structures of syntactic dependencies in the given documents, and consider the following three tasks in this paper: 1)Key semantics extraction: extracting characteristic syntactic dependency structures not only as ordered trees but also as unordered trees and free trees, 2)Redundancy reduction: from the result of extraction, deleting redundant dependency structures such as sub-structures or equivalent structures of the others, and 3)Phrase/sentence reconstruction: generating a phrase or sentence in a natural language corresponding to the extracted structure.Our system is a combination of natural language processing techniques and tree mining techniques. The system consists of the following five units: 1) syntactic dependency analysis unit, 2) input filters, 3) characteristic ordered subtree extraction unit, 4) output filters, and 5) phrase/sentence reconstruction unit. Although ordered trees are extracted in the third unit, the overall behavior of the system can be switched into the extraction of ordered trees, unordered trees, or free trees depending on which of the input filters is/are applied in the second step. The output filters delete redundant trees from the extraction result for efficient knowledge discovery. Finally, phrases or sentences corresponding to the extracted subtrees are reconstructed by utilizing the input documents.We demonstrate the validity of our system by showing experimental results using real data collected at a help desk and TDT pilot corpus.

The extraction of frontal systems from observations and model data can greatly benefit many kinds of research and applications in atmospheric sciences. Due to the huge amount of observational and model data available nowadays, automated extraction of front systems is necessary. This paper presents an automated method to detect frontal systems from numerical model-generated data. In this method, a frontal system is characterized by a vector of features, comprised of parameters derived from the model wind field. K-means clustering is applied to the generated sample set of the feature vectors to partition the feature space and to identify clusters representing the fronts. The probability that a model grid belongs to a front is estimated based on its feature vector. The probability image is generated corresponding to the model grids. A hierarchical thresholding technique is applied to the probability image to identify the frontal systems and a Gaussian Bayes classifier is trained to determine the proper threshold value. This is followed by post processing to filter out false signatures. Experiment results from this method are in good agreement with the ones identified by the domain experts.

The B numbers are chosen to minimize a suitable error between the original data and the estimate derived from the synopsis.Several good one-pass wavelet construction streaming algorithms minimizing the l2 error exist. For other error measures, the problem is less understood. We provide the first one-pass small space streaming algorithms with provable error guarantees (additive approximation) for minimizing a variety of non-Euclidean error measures including all weighted lp (including l∞) and relative error lp metrics.In several previous works solutions (for weighted l2, l∞ and maximum relative error) where the B synopsis coefficients are restricted to be wavelet coefficients of the data were proposed. This restriction yields suboptimal solutions on even fairly simple examples. Other lines of research, such as probabilistic synopsis, imposed restrictions on how the synopsis was arrived at. To the best of our knowledge this paper is the first paper to address the general problem, without any restriction on how the synopsis is arrived at, as well as provide the first streaming algorithms with guaranteed performance for these classes of error measures.

To achieve a better performance, many efficient algorithms have been proposed. Despite these efforts, we are often unable to complete a mining task because these algorithms require a large amount of main memory to enumerate all frequent itemsets, especially when dataset is large or the user-specified support is low. Thus, it becomes apparent that we need to have an efficient main memory handling technique, which allows association rule mining algorithms to handle larger datasets in main memory. To achieve this goal, in this paper we propose an algorithm for vertical association rule mining that compresses a vertical dataset in an efficient manner, using bit vectors. Our performance evaluations show that the compression ratio attained by our proposed technique is better than those of the other well known techniques.

This paper begins by explaining the algorithmic fundamentals of techniques for isometric data embedding and derives a general classification of these techniques. We will see that the nearest neighbor approaches commonly used to construct neighborhood graphs do not guarantee connectedness of the constructed neighborhood graphs and, consequently, may cause an algorithm fail to project data to a single low dimensional coordinate system. In this paper, we review three existing methods to construct k-edge-connected neighborhood graphs and propose a new method to construct k-connected neighborhood graphs. These methods are applicable to a wide range of data including data distributed among clusters. Their features are discussed and compared through experiments.

Unfortunately, error rates for mammograms read by radiologists are high. We examine a particularly difficult to read series of 1618 mammograms where in order to achieve a false positive rate lower than 50%, the false negative rate of radiologists is nearly 25%. We examine a variety of automatic data mining tools in an attempt to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis. Our results suggest that roughly the same or higher accuracy rate than the radiologists can be attained at a much reduced cost. This potential cost savings could have a major financial impact for health care in developing nations.

Most research has focused on tree-structured categories, but in reality directed acyclic graph (DAG) – structured categories, where a child category may have more than one parent category, appear more often. In this paper, we introduce three approaches, namely, flat, tree-based, and DAG-based, for solving the multi-label text classification problem in which categories are organized as a DAG, and documents are classified into both leaf and internal categories. We also present experimental results of the methods using SVMs as classifiers on the Reuters-21578 collection and our data set of research papers in Artificial Intelligence.

This problem is characterized by a huge solution space with a highly multimodal landscape. The algorithm presents fitness function based on expectation, which converts incomplete data to complete data utilizing current best structure of evolutionary process.

The experimental results illustrate that our algorithm can learn a good structure from incomplete data.

Each iteration of the rule extraction algorithm is formulated as a constrained optimization problem that is computationally inexpensive to solve. We discuss various properties of the algorithm and provide proof of convergence for two different optimization criteria We demonstrate the performance and the speed of the algorithm on linear classifiers learned from real-world datasets, including a medical dataset on detection of lung cancer from medical images. The ability to convert SVM's and other ""black-box"" classifiers into a set of human-understandable rules, is critical not only for physician acceptance, but also to reducing the regulatory barrier for medical-decision support systems based on such classifiers."

While this problem is often phrased as a tracking problem, where it is called track initiation, it is useful in a variety of tasks where we want to find correspondences or patterns in spatial-temporal data. Unfortunately, this problem often suffers from a combinatorial explosion in the number of potential sets that must be evaluated. We consider the problem with respect to large-scale asteroid observation data, where the goal is to find associations among the observations that correspond to the same underlying asteroid. In this domain, it is vital that we can efficiently extract the underlying associations.We introduce a new methodology for track initiation that exhaustively considers all possible linkages. We then introduce an exact tree-based algorithm for tractably finding all compatible sets of points. Further, we extend this approach to use multiple trees, exploiting structure from several time steps at once. We compare this approach to a standard sequential approach and show how the use of multiple trees can provide a significant benefit.

This research is a part of the Multiple Sensor Indoor Surveillance (MSIS) project which uses 32 AXIS-2100 webcams that observe an office environment. The research was inspired by the following practical problem: how automatically classify and visualize a 24 hour long video captured by 32 cameras? Raw data are sequences of JPEG images captured by webcams at the rate 2-6 Hz. The following features are extracted from the image data: foreground pixels' spatial distribution and color histogram. The data are integrated by event by averaging motion and color features and creating a ""summary"" frame which accumulates all foreground pixels of frames of the event into one image. The self-organizing map (SOM) approach is applied to event data for clustering and visualization. One-level and two-level SOM clustering are used. A tool for browsing results allows exploring units of the SOM maps at different levels of hierarchy, clusters of units and distances between units in 3D space. A special technique has been developed to visualize rare events. The results are presented and discussed."

In this paper, we suggest an efficient indexing and processing mechanism for such queries. Our indexing method places a sliding window at every possible location of a DNA sequence and extracts its signature by considering the occurrence frequency of each nucleotide. It then stores a set of signatures using a multi-dimensional index, such as the R*-tree. Also, by assigning a weight to each position of a window, it prevents signatures from being concentrated around a few spots in indexing space. Our query processing method converts a query sequence into a multi-dimensional rectangle and searches the index for the signatures overlapped with the rectangle.

Such an approach has the additional advantage of being able to optimize the decision process for the individual record in order to design more effective classification methods. In this paper, we propose the Subspace Decision Path method which provides the user with the ability to interactively explore a small number of nodes of a hierarchical decision process so that the most significant classification characteristics for a given test instance are revealed. In addition, the SD-Path method can provide enormous interpretability by constructing views of the data in which the different classes are clearly separated out. Even in cases where the classification behavior of the test instance is ambiguous, the SD-Path method provides a diagnostic understanding of the characteristics which result in this ambiguity. Therefore, this method combines the abilities of the human and the computer in creating an effective diagnostic tool for instance-centered high dimensional classification.

This data lends itself to a variety of applications and services that can be provided to both buyers and sellers in online marketplaces. We collect data from online auctions and use several classification algorithms to predict the probable-end prices of online auction items. This paper describes the feature extraction and selection process, and several machine learning formulations of the price prediction problem. As a prototype application, we developed Auction Price Insurance that uses the predicted end-price to offer price insurance to sellers in online auctions. We define Price Insurance as a service that offers insurance to auction sellers that guarantees a price for their goods, for an appropriate premium. If the item sells for less than the insured price, the seller is reimbursed for the difference. We show that our price prediction techniques are accurate enough to offer price insurance as a profitable business. While this paper deals specifically with online auctions, we believe that this is an interesting case study that applies to dynamic markets where the price of the goods is variable and is affected by both internal and external factors that change over time.

An overlay network specifies the logical connections among peers in a network and is distinct from the physical connections of the network. It determines the order in which peers will be queried when a user is searching for a specific file. To better understand the role of the network overlay structure in the performance of peer-to-peer file sharing protocols, we compare several methods for creating overlay networks. We analyze the networks using data from a campus network for peer-to-peer file sharing that recorded anonymized data on 6,528 users sharing 291,925 music files over an 81-day period. We propose a novel protocol for overlay creation based on a model of user preference identified by latent-variable clustering with hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs). Our simulations and empirical studies show that the clusters of songs created by HDPs effectively model user behavior and can be used to create desirable network overlays that outperform alternative approaches.

Application domains for IDAS are numerous and include the emerging area of homeland security.Developing test cases for an IDAS requires background data sets into which hypothetical future scenarios can be overlaid. The IDAS can then be measured in terms of false positive and false negative error rates. Obtaining the test data sets can be an obstacle due to both privacy issues and also the time and cost associated with collecting a diverse set of data sources.In this paper, we give an overview of the design and architecture of an IDAS Data Set Generator (IDSG) that enables a fast and comprehensive test of an IDAS. The IDSG generates data using statistical and rule-based algorithms and also semantic graphs that represent interdependencies between attributes. A credit card transaction application is used to illustrate the approach.

Their key advantage is the ability to capture various non--independent and overlapping features of inputs. However, several unexpected pitfalls have a negative influence on the model's performance; these mainly come from an imbalance among classes/labels, irregular phenomena, and potential ambiguity in the training data. This paper presents a data--driven approach that can deal with such hard--to--predict data instances by discovering and emphasizing rare--but--important associations of statistics hidden in the training data. Mined associations are then incorporated into these models to deal with difficult examples. Experimental results of English phrase chunking and named entity recognition using CRFs show a significant improvement in accuracy. In addition to the technical perspective, our approach also highlights a potential connection between association mining and statistical learning by offering an alternative strategy to enhance learning performance with interesting and useful patterns discovered from large dataset.

A personal profile, called CommunityNet, is established for each individual based on a novel algorithm incorporating contact, content, and time information simultaneously.

Our new algorithm is developed based on the combination of dynamic algorithms in the social network field and the semantic content classification methods in the natural language processing and machine learning literatures. We tested CommunityNets on the Enron Email corpus and report experimental results including filtering, prediction, and recommendation capabilities. We show that the personal behavior and intention are somewhat predictable based on these models. For instance, ""to whom a person is going to send a specific email"" can be predicted by one's personal social network and content analysis. Experimental results show the prediction accuracy of the proposed adaptive algorithm is 58% better than the social network-based predictions, and is 75% better than an aggregated model based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation with social network enhancement.

In a recent work, we proposed a method for computing CPK which is restricted to graphs containing polynomial number of simple cycles. In this work, we present two approaches relaxing this limitation. We first show that for graphs of bounded treewidth, CPK can be computed in time polynomial in the number of cyclic patterns, which in turn can be exponentially smaller than that of simple cycles. We then propose an alternative CPK based on the set of relevant cycles which is known to be enumerable with polynomial delay and its cardinality is typically only cubic in the number of vertices. Empirical results on the NCI-HIV dataset indicate that there is no significant difference in predictive performance between CPK based on simple cycles and that based on relevant cycles.

We discuss how sensor stream data could be represented that facilitates efficient online mining and propose the interval-list representation. Based on Lossy Counting, we propose ILB, an interval-list-based online mining algorithm for discovering frequent sensor value sets. Through extensive experiments, we compare the performance of ILB against an application of Lossy Counting (LC) using a weighted transformation method. Results show that ILB outperforms LC significantly for large sensor networks.

The objective is to optimize maintenance and operation of trains through prognostics of wheel failures. In addition to reducing maintenance costs, the proposed technology will help improve railway safety and augment throughput. Building on established techniques from data mining and machine learning, we present a methodology to learn models to predict train wheel failures from readily available operational and maintenance data. This methodology addresses various data mining tasks such as automatic labeling, feature extraction, model building, model fusion, and evaluation. After a detailed description of the methodology, we report results from large-scale experiments. These results clearly show the great potential of this innovative application of data mining in the railway industry.

We use this approach to efficiently pinpoint maximal patterns at the border of the frequent patterns in the lattice and collect enough information in the process to generate all subsequent patterns.

Instance attributes are initially unknown, and may take significant time to measure. This results in a difficult problem, trying to manage the tradeoff between time and accuracy. The problem is further complicated when we consider a sequence of time-sensitive classification instances, where time spent measuring attributes in one instance can adversely affect the costs of future instances. We solve these problems using a decision theoretic approach. The problem is modeled as an MDP with a potentially very large state space. We discuss how to intelligently discretize time and approximate the effects of measurement actions in the current instance given all waiting instances. The results offer an effective approach to attribute measurement and classification for a variety of time sensitive applications. Copyright 2005 ACM.

Association rule mining (ARM) identifies frequent itemsets from databases and generates association rules by considering each item in equal value. However, items are actually different in many aspects in a number of real applications, such as retail marketing, network log, etc. The difference between items makes a strong impact on the decision making in these applications. Therefore, traditional ARM cannot meet the demands arising from these applications. By considering the different values of individual items as utilities, utility mining focuses on identifying the itemsets with high utilities. As “downward closure property” doesn't apply to utility mining, the generation of candidate itemsets is the most costly in terms of time and memory space. In this paper, we present a Two-Phase algorithm to efficiently prune down the number of candidates and can precisely obtain the complete set of high utility itemsets. In the first phase, we propose a model that applies the “transaction-weighted downward closure property” on the search space to expedite the identification of candidates. In the second phase, one extra database scan is performed to identify the high utility itemsets. We also parallelize our algorithm on shared memory multi-process architecture using Common Count Partitioned Database (CCPD) strategy. We verify our algorithm by applying it to both synthetic and real databases. It performs very efficiently in terms of speed and memory cost, and shows good scalability on multiple processors, even on large databases that are difficult for existing algorithms to handle.

We adopt the concept of edge connectivity and apply the results from graph theory, to speed up the mining process. Two approaches are developed to handle different mining requests: CloseCut, a pattern-growth approach, and splat, a pattern-reduction approach. We have applied these methods in biological datasets and found the discovered patterns interesting.

As in other post-marketing drug safety data sets, the presence of duplicate records is an important data quality problem and the detection of duplicates in the WHO drug safety database remains a formidable challenge, especially since the reports are anonymised before submitted to the database. However, to our knowledge no work has been published on methods for duplicate detection in post-marketing drug safety data. In this paper, we propose a method for probabilistic duplicate detection based on the hit-miss model for statistical record linkage described by Copas & Hilton. We present two new generalisations of the standard hit-miss model: a hit-miss mixture model for errors in numerical record fields and a new method to handle correlated record fields. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the hit-miss model for duplicate detection in the WHO drug safety database both at identifying the most likely duplicate for a given record (94.7% accuracy) and at discriminating duplicates from random matches (63% recall with 71% precision). The proposed method allows for more efficient data cleaning in post-marketing drug safety data sets, and perhaps other applications throughout the KDD community.

Keywords Fraud detection+statistical relational learning+relational probability	We describe an application of relational knowledge discovery to a key regulatory mission of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). NASD is the world's largest private-sector securities regulator, with responsibility for preventing and discovering misconduct among securities brokers. Our goal was to help focus NASD's limited regulatory resources on the brokers who are most likely to engage in securities violations. Using statistical relational learning algorithms, we developed models that rank brokers with respect to the probability that they would commit a serious violation of securities regulations in the near future. Our models incorporate organizational relationships among brokers (e.g., past coworker), which domain experts consider important but have not been easily used before now. The learned models were subjected to an extensive evaluation using more than 18 months of data unseen by the model developers and comprising over two person weeks of effort by NASD staff. Model predictions were found to correlate highly with the subjective evaluations of experienced NASD examiners. Furthermore, in all performance measures, our models performed as well as or better than the handcrafted rules that are currently in use at NASD.

We identify three key factors for comparing graph-based and logic-based multi-relational data mining; namely, the ability to discover structurally large concepts, the ability to discover semantically complicated concepts and the ability to effectively utilize background knowledge. We perform an experimental comparison of Subdue and CProgol on the Mutagenesis domain and various artificially generated Bongard problems. Experimental results indicate that Subdue can significantly outperform CProgol while discovering structurally large multi-relational concepts. It is also observed that CProgol is better at learning semantically complicated concepts and it tends to use background knowledge more effectively than Subdue.

The order might be total or partial: for example, two sites in different parts of the globe might be ecologically incomparable, or the ordering of certain markers might be different in different subgroups of the data. We consider the following problem. Given a table over a set of 0-1 variables, find a partial order for the rows minimizing a score function and being as specific as possible. The score function can be, e.g., the number of changes from 1 to 0 in a column (for paleontology) or the likelihood of the marker sequence (for genomic data). Our solution for this task first constructs small totally ordered fragments of the partial order, then finds good orientations for the fragments, and finally uses a simple and efficient heuristic method for finding a partial order that corresponds well with the collection of fragments. We describe the method, discuss its properties, and give empirical results on paleontological data demonstrating the usefulness of the method. In the application the use of the method highlighted some previously unknown properties of the data and pointed out probable errors in the data.

By integrating the concept hierarchy for semantic image concept organization, a hierarchical mixture model is proposed to enable multi-level modeling of semantic image concepts and hierarchical classifier combination. Thus, learning the classifiers for the semantic image concepts at the high level of the concept hierarchy can be effectively achieved by detecting the presences of the relevant base-level atomic image concepts. To effectively learn the base-level classifiers for the atomic image concepts at the first level of the concept hierarchy, we have proposed a novel adaptive EM algorithm to achieve more effective model selection and parameter estimation. In addition, a novel penalty term is proposed to effectively eliminate the misleading effects of the outlying unlabeled images on semi-supervised classifier training. Our experimental results in a specific image domain of outdoor photos are very attractive.

Nomograms are an established model visualization technique that can graphically encode the complete model on a single page. The dimensionality of the visualization does not depend on the number of attributes, but merely on the properties of the kernel. To represent the effect of each predictive feature on the log odds ratio scale as required for the nomograms, we employ logistic regression to convert the distance from the separating hyperplane into a probability. Case studies on selected data sets show that for a technique thought to be a black-box, nomograms can clearly expose its internal structure. By providing an easy-to-interpret visualization the analysts can gain insight and study the effects of predictive factors.

In this paper, we study a particular TTM task -- discovering and summarizing the evolutionary patterns of themes in a text stream. We define this new text mining problem and present general probabilistic methods for solving this problem through (1) discovering latent themes from text; (2) constructing an evolution graph of themes; and (3) analyzing life cycles of themes. Evaluation of the proposed methods on two different domains (i.e., news articles and literature) shows that the proposed methods can discover interesting evolutionary theme patterns effectively.

Furthermore, our new scheme can be readily integrated as a middleware with existing systems.

The performance is measured in terms of the accuracy of data mining results and the privacy protection of sensitive data. On the accuracy side, we address the problem of previous measures and propose a new measure, named “effective sample size”, to solve this problem. We show that our new measure can be bounded without any knowledge of the data being mined, and discuss when the bound can be met. On the privacy protection side, we identify a tacit assumption made by previous measures and show that the assumption is unrealistic in many situations. To solve the problem, we introduce a game theoretic framework for the measurement of privacy.

This dynamic and single pass setting can be cast within the framework of mining evolving data streams. In this paper, we explore the task of mining mass user profiles by discovering evolving Web session clusters in a single pass with a recently proposed scalable immune based clustering approach (TECNO-STREAMS), and study the effect of the choice of different similarity measures on the mining process and on the interpretation of the mined patterns. We propose a simple similarity measure that has the advantage of explicitly coupling the precision and coverage criteria to the early learning stages, and furthermore requiring that the affinity of the data to the learned profiles or summaries be defined by the minimum of their coverage or precision, hence requiring that the learned profiles are simultaneously precise and complete, with no compromises.In our experiments, we study the task of mining evolving user profiles from Web clickstream data (web usage mining) in a single pass, and under different trend sequencing scenarios, showing that compared oto the cosine similarity measure, the proposed similarity measure explicitly based on precision and coverage allows the discovery of more correct profiles at the same precision or recall quality levels.

Web usage mining techniques are used to extract useful knowledge about user interests from such data. The discovered user models are then used for a variety of applications such as personalized recommendations. Web site content or semantic features of objects provide another source of knowledge for deciphering users' needs or interests. We propose a novel Web recommendation system in which collaborative features such as navigation or rating data as well as the content features accessed by the users are seamlessly integrated under the maximum entropy principle. Both the discovered user patterns and the semantic relationships among Web objects are represented as sets of constraints that are integrated to fit the model. In the case of content features, we use a new approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover the hidden semantic relationships among items and derive constraints used in the model. Experiments on real Web site usage data sets show that this approach can achieve better recommendation accuracy, when compared to systems using only usage information. The integration of semantic information also allows for better interpretation of the generated recommendations.

Building on the prior work on spatial and space-time scan statistics, our methods combine time series analysis (to determine how many cases we expect to observe for a given spatial region in a given time interval) with new ""emerging cluster"" space-time scan statistics (to decide whether an observed increase in cases in a region is significant), enabling fast and accurate detection of emerging outbreaks. We evaluate these methods on two types of simulated outbreaks: aerosol release of inhalational anthrax (e.g. from a bioterrorist attack) and FLOO (""Fictional Linear Onset Outbreak""), injected into actual baseline data (Emergency Department records and over-the-counter drug sales data from Allegheny County). We demonstrate that our methods are successful in rapidly detecting both outbreak types while keeping the number of false positives low, and show that our new ""emerging cluster"" scan statistics consistently outperform the standard ""persistent cluster"" scan statistics approach."

The principal innovation proposed in the paper is a method called VizRank, which is able to score and identify the best among possibly millions of candidate projections for visualizations. Compared to recently much applied techniques in the field of cancer genomics that include neural networks, support vector machines and various ensemble-based approaches, VizRank is fast and finds visualization models that can be easily examined and interpreted by domain experts. Our experiments on a number of gene expression data sets show that VizRank was always able to find data visualizations with a small number of (two to seven) genes and excellent class separation. In addition to providing grounds for gene expression cancer diagnosis, VizRank and its visualizations also identify small sets of relevant genes, uncover interesting gene interactions and point to outliers and potential misclassifications in cancer data sets.

The burgeoning amount of textual data in distributed sources combined with the obstacles involved in creating and maintaining central repositories motivates the need for effective distributed information extraction and mining techniques. Recently, as the need to mine patterns across distributed databases has grown, Distributed Association Rule Mining (D-ARM) algorithms have been developed. These algorithms, however, assume that the databases are either horizontally or vertically distributed. In the special case of databases populated from information extracted from textual data, existing D-ARM algorithms cannot discover rules based on higher-order associations between items in distributed textual documents that are neither vertically nor horizontally distributed, but rather a hybrid of the two. In this article we present D-HOTM, a framework for Distributed Higher Order Text Mining. D-HOTM is a hybrid approach that combines information extraction and distributed data mining. We employ a novel information extraction technique to extract meaningful entities from unstructured text in a distributed environment. The information extracted is stored in local databases and a mapping function is applied to identify globally unique keys. Based on the extracted information, a novel distributed association rule mining algorithm is applied to discover higher-order associations between items (i.e., entities) in records fragmented across the distributed databases using the keys. Unlike existing algorithms, D-HOTM requires neither knowledge of a global schema nor that the distribution of data be horizontal or vertical. Evaluation methods are proposed to incorporate the performance of the mapping function into the traditional support metric used in ARM evaluation. An example application of the algorithm on distributed law enforcement data demonstrates the relevance of DHOTM in the fight against terrorism.

A health care claims processing application is introduced which processes both structured and unstructured information associated with medical insurance claims. The application makes use of a natural language processing (NLP) engine, together with application-specific knowledge, written in a concept specification language. Using NLP techniques, the entities and relationships that act as indicators of recoverable claims are mined from management notes, call centre logs and patient records to identify medical claims that require further investigation. Text mining techniques can then be applied to find dependencies between different entities, and to combine indicators to provide scores to individual claims. Claims are scored to determine whether they involve potential fraud or abuse, or to determine whether claims should be paid by or in conjunction with other insurers or organizations. Dependencies between claims and other records can then be combined to create cases. Issues related to the design of the application are discussed, specifically the use of rule-based techniques which provide a capability for deeper analysis than traditionally found in statistical techniques.

In DNA microarray analysis, the expression levels of two closely related genes may rise and fall synchronously in response to a set of experimental stimuli. Although the magnitude of their expression levels may not be close, the patterns they exhibit can be very similar. Unfortunately, none of the conventional distance metrics such as the Lp norm can model this similarity effectively. In this paper, we study the near-neighbor search problem based on this new type of similarity. We propose to measure the distance between two genes by subspace pattern similarity, i.e., whether they exhibit a synchronous pattern of rise and fall on a subset of dimensions. We then present an efficient algorithm for subspace near-neighbor search based on pattern similarity distance, and we perform tests on various data sets to show its effectiveness.

In this paper, a novel feature bagging approach for detecting outliers in very large, high dimensional and noisy databases is proposed. It combines results from multiple outlier detection algorithms that are applied using different set of features. Every outlier detection algorithm uses a small subset of features that are randomly selected from the original feature set. As a result, each outlier detector identifies different outliers, and thus assigns to all data records outlier scores that correspond to their probability of being outliers. The outlier scores computed by the individual outlier detection algorithms are then combined in order to find the better quality outliers. Experiments performed on several synthetic and real life data sets show that the proposed methods for combining outputs from multiple outlier detection algorithms provide non-trivial improvements over the base algorithm.

In streaming time series the Clustering problem is more complex, since the dynamic nature of streaming data makes previous clustering methods inappropriate. In this paper, we propose firstly a new method to evaluate Clustering in streaming time series databases. First, we introduce a novel multiresolution PAA (MPAA) transform to achieve our iterative clustering algorithm. The method is based on the use of a multi-resolution piecewise aggregate approximation representation, which is used to extract features of time series. Then, we propose our iterative clustering approach for streaming time series. We take advantage of the multiresolution property of MPPA and equip a stopping criteria based on Hoeffding bound in order to achieve fast response time. Our streaming time-series clustering algorithm also works by leveraging off the nearest neighbors of the incoming streaming time series datasets and fulfill incremental clustering approach. The comprehensive experiments based on several publicly available real data sets shows that significant performance improvement is achieved and produce high-quality clusters in comparison to the previous methods.

This paper provides an introduction to this special issue of SIGKDD Explorations devoted to Natural Language Processing and Text Mining. NLP has been around for a number of decades. It has developed various techniques that are typically linguistically inspired, i.e. text is typically syntactically parsed using information from a formal grammar and a lexicon, the resulting information is then interpreted semantically and used to extract information about what was said. NLP may be deep (parsing every part of every sentence and attempting to account semantically for every part) or shallow (parsing only certain passages or phrases within sentences or producing only limited semantic analysis), and may even use statistical means to disambiguate word senses or multiple parses of the same sentence. It tends to focus on one document or piece of text at a time and be rather computationally expensive. It includes techniques like word stemming (removing suffixes) or a related technique, lemmatization (replacing an inflected word with its base form), multiword phrase grouping, synonym normalization, part-of-speech (POS) tagging (elaborations on noun, verb, preposition etc.), word-sense disambiguation, anaphora resolution (who does “he” or “the CEO” refer to), and role determination (e.g. subject and object).

In some situations, a normative workflow model of such processes is developed, and it becomes important to know if such a model is actually being followed by analyzing the available activity logs. In other scenarios, no model is available and, with the purpose of evaluating cases or creating new production policies, one is interested in learning a workflow representation of such activities. In either case, machine learning tools that can mine workflow models are of great interest and still relatively unexplored. We present here a probabilistic workflow model and a corresponding learning algorithm that runs in polynomial time. We illustrate the algorithm on example data derived from a real world workflow.

However, the bottleneck of frequent-pattern mining is not at the efficiency but at the interpretability, due to the huge number of patterns generated by the mining process.In this paper, we examine how to summarize a collection of itemset patterns using only K representatives, a small number of patterns that a user can handle easily. The K representatives should not only cover most of the frequent patterns but also approximate their supports. A generative model is built to extract and profile these representatives, under which the supports of the patterns can be easily recovered without consulting the original dataset. Based on the restoration error, we propose a quality measure function to determine the optimal value of parameter K. Polynomial time algorithms are developed together with several optimization heuristics for efficiency improvement. Empirical studies indicate that we can obtain compact summarization in real datasets.

While the co-clustering algorithms for two types of heterogeneous data (denoted by pair-wise co-clustering), such as documents and terms, have been well studied in the literature, the work on more types of heterogeneous data (denoted by high-order co-clustering) is still very limited. As an attempt in this direction, in this paper, we worked on a specific case of high-order co-clustering in which there is a central type of objects that connects the other types so as to form a star structure of the inter-relationships. Actually, this case could be a very good abstract for many real-world applications, such as the co-clustering of categories, documents and terms in text mining. In our philosophy, we treated such kind of problems as the fusion of multiple pair-wise co-clustering sub-problems with the constraint of the star structure. Accordingly, we proposed the concept of consistent bipartite graph co-partitioning, and developed an algorithm based on semi-definite programming (SDP) for efficient computation of the clustering results. Experiments on toy problems and real data both verified the effectiveness of our proposed method.

However, in the context of a particular query distribution, the approximation thus produced need not be optimal. We propose VLSI, a new query-dependent (or ""variable"") low-rank approximation that minimizes approximation error for any specified query distribution. With this tool, it is possible to tailor the LSI technique to particular settings, often resulting in vastly improved approximations at much lower dimensionality. We validate this method via a series of experiments on classical corpora, showing that VLSI typically performs similarly to LSI with an order of magnitude fewer dimensions."

Among several variations of sequential patterns, closed sequential pattern is the most useful one since it retains all the information of the complete pattern set but is often much more compact than it. Unfortunately, there is no parallel closed sequential pattern mining method proposed yet. In this paper we develop an algorithm, called Par-CSP (Parallel Closed Sequential Pattern mining), to conduct parallel mining of closed sequential patterns on a distributed memory system. Par-CSP partitions the work among the processors by exploiting the divide-and-conquer property so that the overhead of interprocessor communication is minimized. Par-CSP applies dynamic scheduling to avoid processor idling. Moreover, it employs a technique, called selective sampling to address the load imbalance problem. We implement Par-CSP using MPI on a 64-node Linux cluster. Our experimental results show that Par-CSP attains good parallelization efficiencies on various input datasets.

This paper examines whether classifier utility can be improved by altering the misclassification cost ratio (the ratio of false positive misclassification costs to false negative misclassification costs) associated with two-class datasets. This is evaluated by varying the cost ratio passed into two cost-sensitive learners and then evaluating the results using the actual (or presumed actual) cost information. Our results indicate that a cost ratio other than the true ratio often maximizes classifier utility. Furthermore, by using a hold out set to identify the “best” cost ratio for learning, we are able to take advantage of this behavior and generate classifiers that outperform the accepted strategy of always using the actual cost information during the learning phase.

The mining problem is to discover unexpected patterns: our goal is to find the strongest discrepancies between network and database. This problem is intrinsically difficult because it requires inference in a Bayesian network and processing the entire, potentially very large, database. A sampling-based method that we introduce is efficient and yet provably finds the approximately most interesting unexpected patterns. We give a rigorous proof of the method's correctness. Experiments shed light on its efficiency and practicality for large-scale Bayesian networks and databases.

This paper presents a new formulation for cost-sensitive learning that we call the One-Bene t formulation. Instead of having the correct label for each training example as in the standard classi er learning formulation, in this formulation we have one possible label for each example (which may not be the correct one) and the bene t (or cost) associated with that label. The goal of learning in this formulation is to nd the classi er that maximizes the expected benet of the labelling using only these examples. We present a reduction from One-Bene t learning to standard classi er learning that allows us to use any existing error-minimizing classi er learner to maximize the expected bene t in this formulation by correctly weighting the examples. We also show how to evaluate a classi er using test examples for which we only the bene t for one of the labels. We present preliminary experimental results using a synthetic data generator that allows us to test both our learning method and our evaluation method.

Applications of our algorithms include superior summarization of news search results, improved browsing paradigms for large collections of text-intensive corpora, and integration of time-stamped documents from a variety of sources. Experimental results based on over 250,000 news articles from a major newspaper over a period of four years demonstrate that our algorithms efficiently identify robust threads of varying lengths and time-spans.

We conjecture that the weaknesses are due to a lack of inductive bias in the learning methods used to build the prediction models. We propose a new method that extends the utility model and assumes that the structure of user preferences follows an ontology of product attributes. Using the data of the MovieLens system, we show experimentally that real user preferences indeed closely follow an ontology based on movie attributes. Furthermore, a recommender based just on a single individual’s preferences and this ontology performs better than collaborative filtering, with the greatest differences when little data about the user is available. This points the way to how proper inductive bias can be used for significantly more powerful recommender systems in the future.

Because time series are a ubiquitous and increasingly prevalent type of data, there has been much research effort devoted to time series data mining recently. As with all data mining problems, the key to effective and scalable algorithms is choosing the right representation of the data. Many high level representations of time series have been proposed for data mining. In this work, we introduce a new technique based on a bit level approximation of the data. The representation has several important advantages over existing techniques. One unique advantage is that it allows raw data to be directly compared to the reduced representation, while still guaranteeing lower bounds to Euclidean distance. This fact can be exploited to produce faster exact algorithms for similarly search. In addition, we demonstrate that our new representation allows time series clustering to scale to much larger datasets.

Very large-scale classification taxonomies typically have hundreds of thousands of categories, deep hierarchies, and skewed category distribution over documents. However, it is still an open question whether the state-of-the-art technologies in automated text categorization can scale to (and perform well on) such large taxonomies. In this paper, we report the first evaluation of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in web-page classification over the full taxonomy of the Yahoo! categories. Our accomplishments include: 1) a data analysis on the Yahoo! taxonomy; 2) the development of a scalable system for large-scale text categorization; 3) theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation of SVMs in hierarchical and non-hierarchical settings for classification; 4) an investigation of threshold tuning algorithms with respect to time complexity and their effect on the classification accuracy of SVMs. We found that, in terms of scalability, the hierarchical use of SVMs is efficient enough for very large-scale classification; however, in terms of effectiveness, the performance of SVMs over the Yahoo! Directory is still far from satisfactory, which indicates that more substantial investigation is needed.

We define kernel functions over relational schemata which are instances of (Re)-Convolution kernels and use them as a basis for a relational instance-based learning algorithm. These kernels can be considered as being defined over typed and unordered trees where elementary kernels are used to compute the graded similarity between nodes. We investigate their formal properties and evaluate the performance of the relational instance-based algorithm on a number of relational data sets.

What are ""normal"" growth patterns in social, technological, and information networks? Many studies have discovered patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a large network, or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena, and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time.Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time, with the number of edges growing super-linearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time, in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)).Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior, even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a ""forest fire"" spreading process, that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires very few parameters (like the ""flammability"" of nodes), and produces graphs exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present study."

The time needed to adequately evaluate the tradeoffs associated with adding any new feature has become a critical issue. Recent work has found that by identifying execution phases present in common workloads used in simulation studies, we can apply clustering algorithms to significantly reduce the amount of time needed to complete the simulation. Our goal in this paper is to demonstrate the value of this approach when applied to the set of industry-standard benchmarks most commonly used in computer architecture studies. We also look to improve upon prior work by applying more appropriate clustering algorithms to identify phases, and to further reduce simulation time.We find that the phase clustering in computer architecture simulation has many similarities to text clustering. In prior work on clustering techniques to reduce simulation time, K-means clustering was used to identify representative program phases. In this paper we apply a mixture of multinomials to the clustering problem and show its advantages over using K-means on simulation data. We have implemented these two clustering algorithms and evaluate how well they can characterize program behavior. By adopting a mixture of multinomials model, we find that we can maintain simulation result fidelity, while greatly reducing overall simulation time. We report results for a range of applications taken from the SPEC2000 benchmark suite.

Using real data gathered from several enterprise systems in Hewlett-Packard, we compare several approaches ranging from time series to Bayesian networks. Besides establishing the predictive power of these approaches our study analyzes three dimensions that are important for their application as a stand alone tool. First, it quantifies the gain in accuracy of multivariate prediction methods over simple statistical univariate methods. Second, it quantifies the variations in accuracy when using different classes of system and workload features. Third, it establishes that models induced using combined data from various systems generalize well and are applicable to new systems, enabling accurate predictions on systems with insufficient historical data. Together this analysis offers a promising outlook on the development of tools to automate assignment of resources to stabilize performance, (e.g., adding servers to a cluster) and allow opportunistic job scheduling (e.g., backups or virus scans).

The search is guided by a utility function, trading off the coverage of rules against their statistical unusualness. One shortcoming of existing approaches is that they do not incorporate prior knowledge. To this end a novel generic sampling strategy is proposed. It allows to turn pattern mining into an iterative process. In each iteration the focus of subgroup discovery lies on those patterns that are unexpected with respect to prior knowledge and previously discovered patterns. The result of this technique is a small diverse set of understandable rules that characterise a specified property of interest. As another contribution this article derives a simple connection between subgroup discovery and classifier induction. For a popular utility function this connection allows to apply any standard rule induction algorithm to the task of subgroup discovery after a step of stratified resampling. The proposed techniques are empirically compared to state of the art subgroup discovery algorithms.

In this paper, we propose a general cross-lingual text mining method that does not rely on any of these resources, but can exploit comparable bilingual text corpora to discover mappings between words and documents in different languages. Comparable text corpora are collections of text documents in different languages that are about similar topics; such text corpora are often naturally available (e.g., news articles in different languages published in the same time period). The main idea of our method is to exploit frequency correlations of words in different languages in the comparable corpora and discover mappings between words in different languages. Such mappings can then be used to further discover mappings between documents in different languages, achieving cross-lingual information integration. Evaluation of the proposed method on a 120MB Chinese-English comparable news collection shows that the proposed method is effective for mapping words and documents in English and Chinese. Since our method only relies on naturally available comparable corpora, it is generally applicable to any language pairs as long as we have comparable corpora.

Conversely, data mining methods for regression and time series analysis generally disregard economic utility and apply simple accuracy measures. Methods from statistics and computational intelligence alike minimise a symmetric statistical error, such as the sum of squared errors, to model ordinary least squares predictors. However, applications in business elucidate that real forecasting problems contain non-symmetric errors. The costs arising from over- versus underprediction are dissimilar for errors of identical magnitude, requiring an ex-post correction of the prediction to derive valid decisions. To reflect this, an asymmetric cost function is developed and employed as the objective function for neural network training, deriving superior forecasts and a cost efficient decision. Experimental results for a business scenario of inventory-levels are computed using a multilayer perceptron trained with different objective functions, evaluating the performance in competition to statistical forecasting methods.

The WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring in Uppsala, Sweden, maintains and analyses the world's largest database of reports on suspected adverse drug reaction incidents that occur after drugs are introduced on the market. As in other post-marketing drug safety data sets, the presence of duplicate records is an important data quality problem and the detection of all duplicates in the WHO drug safety database remains a formidable challenge, especially since the reports are anonymised before submitted to the database. However, to our knowledge no work has been published on methods for duplicate detection in post-marketing drug safety data. In this paper, we propose a method for probabilistic duplicate detection based on the hit-miss model for statistical record linkage described by Copas & Hilton. We present two new generalisations of the standard hit-miss model: a hit-miss mixture model for errors in numerical record elds and a new method to handle correlated record elds. We demonstrate the e ectiveness of the hit-miss model for duplicate detection in the WHO drug safety database both at identifying the most likely duplicate for a given record (94.7% accuracy) and at discriminating duplicates from random matches (63% recall with 71% precision). The proposed method allows for more e cient data cleaning in post-marketing drug safety data sets, and perhaps other applications throughout the KDD community.

Finding a minimal decision tree consistent with the examples is an NP-complete problem. Therefore, most of the existing algorithms for decision tree induction use a greedy approach based on local heuristics. These algorithms usually require a ¯xed small amount of time and result in trees that are not globally optimal. Recently, the LSID3 contract anytime algorithm was introduced to allow using extra resources for building better decision trees. A contract anytime algorithm needs to get its resource allocation a priori. In many cases, however, the time allocation is not known in advance, disallowing the use of contract algorithms. To overcome this problem, in this work we present two interruptible anytime algorithms for inducing decision trees. Interruptible anytime algorithms do not require their resource allocation in advance and thus must be ready to be interrupted and return a valid solution at any moment. The ¯rst interruptible algorithm we propose is based on a general technique for converting a contract algorithm to an interruptible one by sequencing. The second is an iterative improvement algorithm that repeatedly selects a subtree whose reconstruction is estimated to yield the highest marginal utility and rebuilds it with higher resource allocation. Empirical evaluation shows a good anytime behavior for both algorithms. The iterative improvement algorithm shows smoother performance pro¯les which allow more re¯ned control.

One challenge that has not been studied extensively in text mining is the identification and reconstruction of hidden emails. A hidden email is an original email that has been quoted in at least one email in a folder, but does not present itself in the same folder. It may have been (un)intentionally deleted or may never have been received. The discovery and reconstruction of hidden emails is critical for many applications including email classification, summarization and forensics. This paper proposes a framework for reconstructing hidden emails using the embedded quotations found in messages further down the thread hierarchy. We evaluate the robustness and scalability of our framework by using the Enron public email corpus. Our experiments show that hidden emails exist widely in that corpus and also that our optimization techniques are effective in processing large email folders.

A highly-skewed class distribution usually causes the learned classifier to predict the majority class much more often than the minority class. This is a consequence of the fact that most classifiers are designed to maximize accuracy. In many instances, such as for medical diagnosis, the minority class is the class of primary interest and hence this classification behavior is unacceptable. In this paper, we compare two basic strategies for dealing with data that has a skewed class distribution and non-uniform misclassification costs. One strategy is based on cost-sensitive learning while the other strategy employs sampling to create a more balanced class distribution in the training set. We compare two sampling techniques, up-sampling and down-sampling, to the cost-sensitive learning approach. The purpose of this paper is to determine which technique produces the best overall classifier-and under what circumstances.

Traditional approaches involve optimization of graph clustering objectives such as normalized cut or ratio association; spectral methods are widely used for these objectives, but they require eigenvector computation which can be slow. Recently, graph clustering with a general cut objective has been shown to be mathematically equivalent to an appropriate weighted kernel k-means objective function. In this paper, we exploit this equivalence to develop a very fast multilevel algorithm for graph clustering. Multilevel approaches involve coarsening, initial partitioning and refinement phases, all of which may be specialized to different graph clustering objectives. Unlike existing multilevel clustering approaches, such as METIS, our algorithm does not constrain the cluster sizes to be nearly equal. Our approach gives a theoretical guarantee that the refinement step decreases the graph cut objective under consideration. Experiments show that we achieve better final objective function values as compared to a state-of-the-art spectral clustering algorithm: on a series of benchmark test graphs with up to thirty thousand nodes and one million edges, our algorithm achieves lower normalized cut values in 67% of our experiments and higher ratio association values in 100% of our experiments. Furthermore, on large graphs, our algorithm is significantly faster than spectral methods. Finally, our algorithm requires far less memory than spectral methods; we cluster a 1.2 million node movie network into 5000 clusters, which due to memory requirements cannot be done directly with spectral methods.

In this paper, we will describe our research efforts on establishing an integrated framework for mining system log files for automatic management. In particular, we apply text mining techniques to categorize messages in log files into common situations, improve categorization accuracy by considering the temporal characteristics of log messages, develop temporal mining techniques to discover the relationships between different events, and utilize visualization tools to evaluate and validate the interesting temporal patterns for system management.

In contrast to previous work in this area, features are modeled as geometric objects rather than points. We define multiple distance metrics that take into account objects' extent and thus are more robust in capturing the influence of an object on other objects in spatial neighborhood. We have developed algorithms to discover four different types of spatial object interaction (association) patterns. We also extend our approach to accommodate temporal information and propose a simple algorithm to derive spatio-temporal episodes. We show that such episodes can be used to reason about critical events. We evaluate our framework on real datasets to demonstrate its efficacy. The datasets originate from two different areas: Computational Molecular Dynamics and Computational Fluid Flow. We present results highlighting the importance of the identified patterns and episodes by using knowledge from the underlying domains. We also show that the proposed algorithms scale linearly with respect to the dataset size.

In several contexts and domains, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) offers best-quality results, but at the price of a high complexity which reduces the size of datasets which can be handled. In some contexts, in particular, computing distances between objects is the most expensive task. In this paper we propose a pruning heuristics aimed at improving performances in these cases, which is well integrated in all the phases of the HAC process and can be applied to two HAC variants: single-linkage and complete-linkage. After describing the method, we provide some theoretical evidence of its pruning power, followed by an empirical study of its effectiveness over different data domains, with a special focus on dimensionality issues.

In this talk, I will describe a number of machine learning paradigms that are relevant to utility-based data mining, and review some key techniques and results in each. learning paradigm, which we might collectively refer to as active on-line learning addresses the issue of optimizing the combination, and trade-off, of losses incurred during data acquisition, and those associated with the predictive quality of the final hypothesis. Some examples of learning paradigms that fall within this general class include the classic bandit problem [3] and its generalizations and associative reinforcement learning [5, 1]. Theories have been developed on these learning paradigms, which provide learning strategies that come with theoretical guarantee on the total losses, inclusive of the two types of losses. Finally, a comprehensive paradigm of machine learning, which includes all of the ones mentioned so far as special cases, is reinforcement learning. Indeed, some authors have embedded instances of utilitybased data mining problems within the MDP framework (e.g. [6]). While the MDP formulation is the most general, it does not necessarily follow that it will be the most effective in practice. When the problem at hand falls into one of the special cases discussed, the theory and methodology in that special case may be the most effective. I hope to draw some examples of real world applications, for which some of these special cases have indeed proved to be satisfactory. [7] F. Provost. Economic machine learning. In Proc.

Most of these algorithms only take a single table as input, whereas in the real world most data are stored in multiple tables and managed by relational database systems. As transferring data from multiple tables into a single one usually causes many problems, development of multi-relational classification algorithms becomes important and attracts many researchers interests. Existing works about extending Naïve Bayes to deal with multi-relational data either have to transform data stored in tables to mainmemory Prolog facts, or limit the search space to only a small subset of real world applications. In this work, we aim at solving these problems and building an efficient, accurate Naïve Bayesian classifier to deal with data in multiple tables directly. We propose an algorithm named Graph-NB, which upgrades Naïve Bayesian classifier to deal with multiple tables directly. In order to take advantage of linkage relationships among tables, and treat different tables linked to the target table differently, a semantic relationship graph is developed to describe the relationship and to avoid unnecessary joins. Furthermore, to improve accuracy, a pruning strategy is given to simplify the graph to avoid examining too many weakly linked tables. Experimental study on both realworld and synthetic databases shows its high efficiency and good accuracy.

Learning from imbalanced datasets presents an interesting problem both from modeling and economy standpoints. When the imbalance is large, classification accuracy on the smaller class(es) tends to be lower. In particular, when a class is of great interest but occurs relatively rarely such as cases of fraud, instances of disease, and regions of interest in largescale simulations, it is important to accurately identify it. It then becomes more costly to misclassify the interesting class. In this paper, we implement a wrapper approach that computes the amount of under-sampling and synthetic generation of the minority class examples (SMOTE) to improve minority class accuracy. The f-value serves as the evaluation function. Experimental results show the wrapper approach is effective in optimization of the composite f-value, and reduces the average cost per test example for the datasets considered. We report both average cost per test example and the cost curves in the paper. The true positive rate of the minority class increases significantly without causing a significant change in the f-value. We also obtain the lowest cost per test example, compared to any result we are aware of for the KDD Cup-99 intrusion detection data set.

Regardless of the frequent patterns to discover, either the full frequent patterns or the condensed ones, either closed or maximal, the strategy always includes the traversal of the lattice of candidate patterns. We study the existing depth versus breadth traversal approaches for generating candidate patterns and propose in this paper a new traversal approach that jumps in the search space among only promising nodes. Our leaping approach avoids nodes that would not participate in the answer set and reduce drastically the number of candidate patterns. We use this approach to efficiently pinpoint maximal patterns at the border of the frequent patterns in the lattice and collect enough information in the process to generate all subsequent patterns.

For example, in cross-market customer segmentation, a group of customers who behave similarly in multiple markets should be considered as a more coherent and more reliable cluster than clusters found in a single market. As another example, in bioinformatics, by joint mining of gene expression data and protein interaction data, we can find clusters of genes which show coherent expression patterns and also produce interacting proteins. Such clusters may be potential pathways.In this paper, we investigate a novel data mining problem, mining cross-graph quasi-cliques, which is generalized from several interesting applications such as cross-market customer segmentation and joint mining of gene expression data and protein interaction data. We build a general model for mining cross-graph quasi-cliques, show why the complete set of cross-graph quasi-cliques cannot be found by previous data mining methods, and study the complexity of the problem. While the problem is difficult, we develop an efficient algorithm, Crochet, which exploits several interesting and effective techniques and heuristics to efficaciously mine cross-graph quasi-cliques. A systematic performance study is reported on both synthetic and real data sets. We demonstrate some interesting and meaningful cross-graph quasi-cliques in bioinformatics.

In this paper, an alternative method, greedy stagewise algorithm, named GS-SVMs is presented to deal with the overfitting of HM-SVMs without the introduction of capacity control term. The most attractive property of GS-SVMs is that its computational complexity scales quadratically with the size of training samples in the worst case. Extensive empirical comparisons confirm the feasibility and validity GS-SVMs.

We describe an application of relational knowledge discovery to a key regulatory mission of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). NASD is the world's largest private-sector securities regulator, with responsibility for preventing and discovering misconduct among securities brokers. Our goal was to help focus NASD's limited regulatory resources on the brokers who are most likely to engage in securities violations. Using statistical relational learning algorithms, we developed models that rank brokers with respect to the probability that they would commit a serious violation of securities regulations in the near future. Our models incorporate organizational relationships among brokers (e.g., past coworker), which domain experts consider important but have not been easily used before now. The learned models were subjected to an extensive evaluation using more than 18 months of data unseen by the model developers and comprising over two person weeks of eoffrt by NASD sta.ff Model predictions were found to correlate highly with the subjective evaluations of experienced NASD examiners. Furthermore, in all performance measures, our models performed as well as or better than the handcrafted rules that are currently in use at NASD.

Since DNA databases contain a huge volume of sequences, fast indexes are essential for efficient processing of DNA sequence matching. In this paper, we first point out the problems of the suffix tree, an index structure widely-used for DNA sequence matching, in the respects of the storage overhead, search performance, and difficulty in seamless integration with DBMS. Then, we propose a new index structure that resolves such problems. The proposed index structure consists of the two parts: the primary part realizes the trie as binary bit-string representation without any pointers, and the secondary part helps fast accesses of leaf nodes of the trie that need to be accessed for post-processing. We also suggest efficient algorithms based on that index for DNA sequence matching. To verify the superiority of the proposed approach, we conduct performance evaluation via a series of experiments. The results reveal that the proposed approach, which requires smaller storage space, can be a few orders of magnitude faster than the suffix tree.

We propose a simple yet potentially very effective way of visualizing trained support vector machines. Nomograms are an established model visualization technique that can graphically encode the complete model on a single page. The dimensionality of the visualization does not depend on the number of attributes, but merely on the properties of the kernel. To represent the effect of each predictive feature on the log odds ratio scale as required for the nomograms, we employ logistic regression to convert the distance from the separating hyperplane into a probability. Case studies on selected data sets show that for a technique thought to be a black-box, nomograms can clearly expose its internal structure. By providing an easy-to-interpret visualization the analysts can gain insight and study the effects of predictive factors.

SEE has two advantages over previous works in the literature. First, SEE is highly efficient because an appropriate sample size can be determined without the need of executing association rules. Second, the identified sample size of SEE is very accurate, meaning that association rules can be highly efficiently executed on a sample of this size to obtain a sufficiently accurate result. This is attributed to the merit of SEE for being able to significantly reduce the influence of randomness by examining several samples with the same size in one database scan. As validated by experiments on various real data and synthetic data, SEE can achieve very prominent improvement in efficiency and also the resulting accuracy over previous works.

However our projection minimizes different error, and unlike LSI we build a basis, that in many cases corresponds to the actual topics. We present results of testing of our algorithm on the abstracts of arXiv - an electronic repository of scientific papers, and the 20 Newsgroup dataset - a small snapshot of 20 specific newsgroups.

Most of today's structured data resides in relational databases where multiple relations are formed by foreign key joins. In recent years, the field of data mining has played a key role in helping humans analyze and explore large databases. Unfortunately, most methods only utilize “flat” data representations. Thus, to apply these single-table data mining techniques, we are forced to incur a computational penalty by first converting the data into this “flat” form. As a result of this transformation, the data not only loses its compact representation but the semantic information present in the relations are reduced or eliminated. In this paper, we describe a classification approach, which addresses this issue by operating directly on relational databases. The approach, called MVC (Multi-View Classification), is based on a multi-view learning framework. In this framework, the target concept is represented in different views and then independently learned using single-table data mining techniques. After constructing multiple classifiers for the target concept in each view, the learners are validated and combined by a meta-learning algorithm. Two methods are employed in the MVC approach, namely (1) target concept propagation and (2) multi-view learning. The propagation method constructs training sets directly from relational databases for use by the multi-view learners. The learning method employs traditional single-table mining techniques to mine data straight from a multi-relational database. Our experiments on benchmark real-world databases show that the MVC method achieves promising results in terms of overall accuracy obtained and run time, when compared with the FOIL and CrossMine learning methods.

An important approach to text mining involves the use of natural-language information extraction. Information extraction (IE) distills structured data or knowledge from unstructured text by identifying references to named entities as well as stated relationships between such entities. IE systems can be used to directly extricate abstract knowledge from a text corpus, or to extract concrete data from a set of documents which can then be further analyzed with traditional data-mining techniques to discover more general patterns. We discuss methods and implemented systems for both of these approaches and summarize results on mining real text corpora of biomedical abstracts, job announcements, and product descriptions. We also discuss challenges that arise when employing current information extraction technology to discover knowledge in text.

Two major challenges are (1) the data may grow without limit so that it is difficult to retain a long history; and (2) the underlying concept of the data may change over time. Different from common practice that keeps recent raw data, this paper uses a measure of conceptual equivalence to organize the data history into a history of concepts. Along the journey of concept change, it identifies new concepts as well as re-appearing ones, and learns transition patterns among concepts to help prediction. Different from conventional methodology that passively waits until the concept changes, this paper incorporates proactive and reactive predictions. In a proactive mode, it anticipates what the new concept will be if a future concept change takes place, and prepares prediction strategies in advance. If the anticipation turns out to be correct, a proper prediction model can be launched instantly upon the concept change. If not, it promptly resorts to a reactive mode: adapting a prediction model to the new data. A system RePro is proposed to implement these new ideas. Experiments compare the system with representative existing prediction methods on various benchmark data sets that represent diversified scenarios of concept change. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the proposed methodology is an effective and efficient solution to prediction for data streams.

Often the data comes from sensors (in physics and medicine for example) whose data rates continue to improve dramatically as sensor technology improves. Further, the number of sensors is increasing, so correlating data between sensors becomes ever more critical in order to distill knowlege from the data. In many applications such as finance, recent correlations are of far more interest than long-term correlation, so correlation over sliding windows (windowed correlation) is the desired operation. Fast response is desirable in many applications (e.g., to aim a telescope at an activity of interest or to perform a stock trade). These three factors -- data size, windowed correlation, and fast response -- motivate this work.Previous work [10, 14] showed how to compute Pearson correlation using Fast Fourier Transforms and Wavelet transforms, but such techniques don't work for time series in which the energy is spread over many frequency components, thus resembling white noise. For such ""uncooperative"" time series, this paper shows how to combine several simple techniques -- sketches (random projections), convolution, structured random vectors, grid structures, and combinatorial design -- to achieve high performance windowed Pearson correlation over a variety of data sets."

In many classification tasks training data have missing feature values that can be acquired at a cost. For building accurate predictive models, acquiring all missing values is often prohibitively expensive or unnecessary, while acquiring a random subset of feature values may not be most effective. The goal of active feature-value acquisition is to incrementally select feature values that are most cost-effective for improving the model's accuracy. We present two policies, Sampled Expected Utility and Expected Utility-ES, that acquire feature values for inducing a classification model based on an estimation of the expected improvement in model accuracy per unit cost. A comparison of the two policies to each other and to alternative policies demonstrate that Sampled Expected Utility is preferable as it effectively reduces the cost of producing a model of a desired accuracy and exhibits a consistent performance across domains.

The motivation behind this study is that the relation between users and documents can be explained by the two different latent classes, where users belong probabilistically in one or more classes with the same interest groups, while documents also belong probabilistically in one or more class with the same topic groups. The novel aspect of LISM is that it simultaneously provides a user model and latent semantic analysis in one map. This benefit of LISM is to enable collaborative filtering in terms of user interest and document topic and thus solve the cold start problem.

In this paper, we propose to learn a distance function by capturing the nonlinear relationships among contextual information provided by the application, data, or user. We show that through a process called the ""kernel trick,"" such nonlinear relationships can be learned efficiently in a projected space. Theoretically, we substantiate that our method is both sound and optimal. Empirically, using several datasets and applications, we demonstrate that our method is effective and useful."

REC curves describe the cumulative distribution function of the prediction error of models and can be seen as a generalization of ROC curves to regression problems. REC curves provide useful information for analyzing the performance of models, particularly when compared to error statistics like for instance the Mean Squared Error. In this paper we present Regression Error Characteristic (REC) surfaces that introduce a further degree of detail by plotting the cumulative distribution function of the errors across the distribution of the target variable, i.e. the joint cumulative distribution function of the errors and the target variable. This provides a more detailed analysis of the performance of models when compared to REC curves. This extra detail is particularly relevant in applications with non-uniform error costs, where it is important to study the performance of models for specific ranges of the target variable. In this paper we present the notion of REC surfaces, describe how to use them to compare the performance of models, and illustrate their use with an important practical class of applications: the prediction of rare extreme values.

In propositional domains, using a separate test set via random sampling or cross validation is generally considered to be an unbiased estimator of true error. In multirelational domains, previous work has already noted that linkage of objects may cause these procedures to be biased, and has proposed corrected sampling procedures. However, as we show in this paper, the existing procedures only address one particular case of bias introduced by linkage. We recall that in the propositional case cross validation measures off-training set (OTS) error and not true error and illustrate the difference with a small experiment. In the multirelational case, we show that the distinction between training and test set needs to be carefully extended based on a graph of potentially linked objects, and on their assumed probabilities of reoccurrence. We demonstrate that the bias due to linkage to known objects varies with the chosen proportion of the training/test split and present an algorithm, generalized subgraph sampling, that is guaranteed to avoid bias in the test set for more generalized cases.

They are used to improve user experience, say through recommendation of pages, pre-fetching of pages, etc. While browsing behavior changes dynamically over time, many web usage modeling techniques are static due to prohibitive model compilation times and also lack of fast incremental update mechanism. However, profiles have to be maintained so that they dynamically adapt to new interests and trends, since otherwise their use can lead to poor, irrelevant, and mis-targeted recommendations in personalization systems. We present a new profile maintenance scheme, which extends the Relational Fuzzy Subtractive Clustering (RFSC) technique and enables efficient incremental update of usage profiles. An impact factor is defined whose value can be used to decide the need for recompilation. The results from extensive experiments on a large real dataset of web logs show that the proposed maintenance technique, with considerably reduced computational costs, is almost as good as complete remodeling.

First a general binary data clustering model is presented. The model treats the data and features equally, based on their symmetric association relations, and explicitly describes the data assignments as well as feature assignments. We characterize several variations with different optimization procedures for the general model. Second, we also establish the connections between our clustering model with other existing clustering methods. Third, we also discuss the problem for determining the number of clusters for binary clustering. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed clustering model."

The lack of objective criteria render model selection as well as the identification of robust solutions particularly difficult. The use of a stability assessment and the combination of multiple clustering solutions represents an important ingredient to achieve the goal of finding useful partitions. In this work, we propose a novel way of combining multiple clustering solutions for both, hard and soft partitions: the approach is based on modeling the probability that two objects are grouped together. An efficient EM optimization strategy is employed in order to estimate the model parameters. Our proposal can also be extended in order to emphasize the signal more strongly by weighting individual base clustering solutions according to their consistency with the prediction for previously unseen objects. In addition to that, the probabilistic model supports an out-of-sample extension that (i) makes it possible to assign previously unseen objects to classes of the combined solution and (ii) renders the efficient aggregation of solutions possible. In this work, we also shed some light on the usefulness of such combination approaches. In the experimental result section, we demonstrate the competitive performance of our proposal in comparison with other recently proposed methods for combining multiple classifications of a finite data set.

Faster or slower average growth over a time period is explained by building a classification tree containing several categorical variables (both quantitative and qualitative). The technique used – called genAID – splits the population at different levels. It is inspired by the Automatic Interaction Detector (AID) technique to find trees that explain the variability in average growth but uses a genetic algorithm to overcome some of the drawbacks of AID. Classical AID or other tree-growing techniques usually generate a single tree for interpretation. This approach has been criticized because, due to the artifacts of data, spurious interactions may occur. genAID offers the user-analyst a set of trees, which are the best ones found over a number of generations of the genetic algorithm. The user-analyst is then offered the choice of choosing a tree by trading off explanatory power against either the ease of understanding or the conformity with an existing theory.

In a relational graph, each node represents a distinct entity while each edge represents a relationship between entities. Various algorithms were developed to discover interesting patterns from a single relational graph (Z. Wu et al., 1993). However, little attention has been paid to the patterns that are hidden in multiple relational graphs. One interesting pattern in relational graphs is frequent highly connected subgraph which can identify recurrent groups and clusters. In social networks, this kind of pattern corresponds to communities where people are strongly associated. For example, if several researchers co-author some papers, attend the same conferences, and refer their works from each other, it strongly indicates that they are studying the same research theme.

Consensus methods are useful in processing inconsistent knowledge. However, for almost conflict situations consensus may be determined but it is not always sensible. In this paper we investigate the aspect of reasonableness of consensus. For this aim we define two notions: consensus susceptibility and consistency measure. Owing to them one may get to know when it is worth to determine a consensus for a conflict. We show the dependencies between consistency and the consensus susceptibility for conflict situations. Some results of the analysis are presented.

The new algorithms have demonstrated some advantages. So it’s needed to explore the basic principle underlain the algorithms such as whether the kernel function transformation can increase the separability of the input data in clustering and how to use the principle to construct new clustering methods. In this paper, we will discuss the problems.
